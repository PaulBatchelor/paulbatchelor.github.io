<p>These should typically be keyword definitions from
various things being read.

<p><b>[b1588400] 2022-01-05-10-08</b>: imperitive programming: programming that makes extensive use of assignment. (SICP)

<p><b>[7b224cfe] 2022-01-05-10-04</b>: functional programming: programming without assignment (SICP).
</p>
<p><b>[c0eef67b] 2021-12-21-20-07</b>: articulatory inversion: the process of taking acoustic data and converting it back into vocal tract shapes.
</p>
<p><b>[164a2255] 2021-12-11-06-31</b>: message passing: a style of programming found in languages such as LISP/Scheme which involve the ability to manipulate procedures as objects (which automatically provies the ability to represent compound data).
</p>
<p><b>[83af25bf] 2021-12-11-06-27</b>: abstraction barriers: being able to isolate different levels of a system using abstraction.
</p>
<p><b>[5c4fd45e] 2021-12-03-10-20</b>: order of growth: a notion used to describe the rate at which a process consumes computational resources. This is obtained via the gross measure of resources required by a process as the inputs become larger.
</p>
<p><b>[60a162f4] 2021-12-03-10-17</b>: tree recursion: a common pattern of computation. A recursive process whose evolution looks like a tree. in (<a href="/brain/SICP">SICP</a>), the fibonacci algorithm is used as an example of a process with tree recursion.
</p>
<p><b>[df8a770b] 2021-12-03-10-09</b>: linear iterative process: an interative process whose growth is linear.
</p>
<p><b>[3213c89c] 2021-12-03-10-07</b>: iterative process: a process whose state can be summarized by a fixed number of state variables, together with a fixed rule that describes how the state variables should be updated as the process moves from state to state and an optional end test that specifies conditions under which the process should terminate.
</p>
<p><b>[8d060b80] 2021-12-03-10-05</b>: linear recursive process: a recursive process that keeps track of a chain of deferred operations. This chain has linear growth.
</p>
<p><b>[df9039dd] 2021-12-03-10-04</b>: recursive process: a process defined by a chain of deferred operations.
</p>
<p><b>[0dec860e] 2021-12-03-10-04</b>: deferred operations: in recursion, operations that are created while a process expands an expression, and are performed during the contraction.
</p>
<p><b>[6b13fa56] 2021-12-03-09-53</b>: imperative descriptions: how-to descriptions. computer scientists are usually concerned with this (vs "what is").
</p>
<p><b>[43977097] 2021-12-03-09-52</b>: imperative description: "what" description. mathematics are concerned with this (vs "how to").
</p>
<p><b>[0a1e66b2] 2021-12-03-09-48</b>: predicate: procedures that return true or false.
</p>
<p><b>[3c37b7af] 2021-12-03-09-47</b>: consequent expression: the value of the corresponding expression associated with a predicate that is true. used in conditional expressions.
</p>
<p><b>[8347a6a9] 2021-12-03-09-14</b>: clause: in lisp, a parenthesized pair of expressions that follow the cond symbol.
</p>
<p><b>[4e8e776f] 2021-12-03-09-12</b>: case analysis: a special form in lisp that can make tests and perform different operations depending on the result of the test.
</p>
<p><b>[4128c915] 2021-12-03-09-09</b>: applicative-order evaluation: an evaluation method that evaluates the arguments and then applies. this is the method that the scheme interpreter uses.
</p>
<p><b>[5170f643] 2021-12-03-09-08</b>: normal order evaluation: an evaluation method that fully expands and then reduces.
</p>
<p><b>[cc905d10] 2021-12-03-09-05</b>: procedure definitions: a compound operation that can be given a name and then referred as a unit.
</p>
<p><b>[60c6c350] 2021-12-03-09-00</b>: special forms: exceptions to the general evaluation rule. <code>define</code> in scheme is an example of a special form.
</p>
<p><b>[4eeaa860] 2021-12-03-08-58</b>: recursive: evaluation rule that includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule itself.
</p>
<p><b>[ef93d5f9] 2021-12-03-08-56</b>: environment: some sort of memory in the interpreter that keeps track of name-object pairs. more precisely called the global environment.
</p>
<p><b>[f7831585] 2021-12-03-08-55</b>: read-eval-print loop: the operation cycle of interpreter. read an expression from the terminal, evalulate the expression, and print the result.
