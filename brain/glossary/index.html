<h1>Glossary</h1>
<p>Specially formatted messages tagged with the @glossary
label. Format should be word:definition.
</p>
<p><b>ALU</b>: arithmetic logic unit.
</p>
<p><b>CPU</b>: central processing unit. the engine that interprets (or executes) instructions stored in main memory.
</p>
<p><b>DMA</b>: direct memory access.
</p>
<p><b>DRAM</b>: dynamic random access memory.
</p>
<p><b>abstraction barriers</b>: being able to isolate different levels of a system using abstraction.
</p>
<p><b>applicative-order evaluation</b>: an evaluation method that evaluates the arguments and then applies. this is the method that the scheme interpreter uses.
</p>
<p><b>articulatory inversion</b>: the process of taking acoustic data and converting it back into vocal tract shapes.
</p>
<p><b>buses</b>: a collection of electrical conduits that carry bytes of information back and forth between components.
</p>
<p><b>case analysis</b>: a special form in lisp that can make tests and perform different operations depending on the result of the test.
</p>
<p><b>clause</b>: in lisp, a parenthesized pair of expressions that follow the cond symbol.
</p>
<p><b>combinations</b>: expressions in lisp formed by delimiting a list of expression within parentheses in order to denote procedure application.
</p>
<p><b>consequent expression</b>: the value of the corresponding expression associated with a predicate that is true. used in conditional expressions.
</p>
<p><b>controller/adapter</b>: the means by which an IO device is connected to the IO bus. The distinction between a controller or an adapter is mainly one of packaging.
</p>
<p><b>crate root</b>: source file that the rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate.
</p>
<p><b>crate</b>: a binary or library.
</p>
<p><b>create a new library restaurant</b>: <code>cargo new --lib restaurant</code>.
</p>
<p><b>deferred operations</b>: in recursion, operations that are created while a process expands an expression, and are performed during the contraction.
</p>
<p><b>environment</b>: some sort of memory in the interpreter that keeps track of name-object pairs. more precisely called the global environment.
</p>
<p><b>functional programming</b>: programming without assignment (SICP).
</p>
<p><b>imperative description</b>: "what" description. mathematics are concerned with this (vs "how to").
</p>
<p><b>imperative descriptions</b>: how-to descriptions. computer scientists are usually concerned with this (vs "what is").
</p>
<p><b>imperitive programming</b>: programming that makes extensive use of assignment. (SICP)
</p>
<p><b>iterative process</b>: a process whose state can be summarized by a fixed number of state variables, together with a fixed rule that describes how the state variables should be updated as the process moves from state to state and an optional end test that specifies conditions under which the process should terminate.
</p>
<p><b>linear iterative process</b>: an interative process whose growth is linear.
</p>
<p><b>linear recursive process</b>: a recursive process that keeps track of a chain of deferred operations. This chain has linear growth.
</p>
<p><b>main memory</b>: a temporary storage device that holds both a program and the data it manipulates while the processor is executing the program.
</p>
<p><b>means of abstraction</b>: compound elements can be named and manipulated as units
</p>
<p><b>means of combination</b>: compound elements are built from simpler ones.
</p>
<p><b>message passing</b>: a style of programming found in languages such as LISP/Scheme which involve the ability to manipulate procedures as objects (which automatically provies the ability to represent compound data).
</p>
<p><b>modules (rust)</b>: thing that organizes code within a crate into groups for readability and easy reuse.
</p>
<p><b>motherboard</b>: systems main printed circuit board.
</p>
<p><b>nested</b>: to have combinations whose elements are themselves combinations.
</p>
<p><b>normal order evaluation</b>: an evaluation method that fully expands and then reduces.
</p>
<p><b>operand</b>: the other elements following the operator.
</p>
<p><b>operator</b>: the leftmost element in the list.
</p>
<p><b>order of growth</b>: a notion used to describe the rate at which a process consumes computational resources. This is obtained via the gross measure of resources required by a process as the inputs become larger.
</p>
<p><b>package</b>: one or more crates that provide a set of functionality.
</p>
<p><b>predicate</b>: procedures that return true or false.
</p>
<p><b>prefix notation</b>: convention of placing operator to the left of the operands.
</p>
<p><b>pretty-printing</b>: a formatting convention in which each long combination is written so that the operands are aligned vertically.
</p>
<p><b>primitive expression</b>: the simplest entities the language is concerned with.
</p>
<p><b>privacy (rust)</b>: in the context of modules, the determination whether an item can be used by outside code (public) or not.
</p>
<p><b>privacy boundary</b>: the line that encapsulates the implementation details isn't allowed to know about, or rely on.
</p>
<p><b>procedure definitions</b>: a compound operation that can be given a name and then referred as a unit.
</p>
<p><b>program counter</b>: a register that points at some machine language instruction in main memory.
</p>
<p><b>read-eval-print loop</b>: the operation cycle of interpreter. read an expression from the terminal, evalulate the expression, and print the result.
</p>
<p><b>recursive process</b>: a process defined by a chain of deferred operations.
</p>
<p><b>recursive</b>: evaluation rule that includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule itself.
</p>
<p><b>register</b>: a word-sized storage device.
</p>
<p><b>special forms</b>: exceptions to the general evaluation rule. <code>define</code> in scheme is an example of a special form.
</p>
<p><b>tree recursion</b>: a common pattern of computation. A recursive process whose evolution looks like a tree. in (<a href="/brain/SICP">SICP</a>), the fibonacci algorithm is used as an example of a process with tree recursion.
</p>
<p><b>word</b>: a fixed size chunk of bytes. Most machines today have word sizes of 4 bytes or 8 bytes.
