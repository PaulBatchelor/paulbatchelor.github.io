various things being read.

<p><b>[8347a6a9] 2021-12-03-09-14</b>: clause: in lisp, a parenthesized pair of expressions that follow the cond symbol.
</p>
<p><b>[4e8e776f] 2021-12-03-09-12</b>: case analysis: a special form in lisp that can make tests and perform different operations depending on the result of the test.
</p>
<p><b>[4128c915] 2021-12-03-09-09</b>: applicative-order evaluation: an evaluation method that evaluates the arguments and then applies. this is the method that the scheme interpreter uses.
</p>
<p><b>[5170f643] 2021-12-03-09-08</b>: normal order evaluation: an evaluation method that fully expands and then reduces.
</p>
<p><b>[cc905d10] 2021-12-03-09-05</b>: procedure definitions: a compound operation that can be given a name and then referred as a unit.
</p>
<p><b>[60c6c350] 2021-12-03-09-00</b>: special forms: exceptions to the general evaluation rule. <code>define</code> in scheme is an example of a special form.
</p>
<p><b>[4eeaa860] 2021-12-03-08-58</b>: recursive: evaluation rule that includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule itself.
</p>
<p><b>[ef93d5f9] 2021-12-03-08-56</b>: environment: some sort of memory in the interpreter that keeps track of name-object pairs. more precisely called the global environment.
</p>
<p><b>[f7831585] 2021-12-03-08-55</b>: read-eval-print loop: the operation cycle of interpreter. read an expression from the terminal, evalulate the expression, and print the result.
</p>
<p><b>[482364c0] 2021-12-03-08-53</b>: pretty-printing: a formatting convention in which each long combination is written so that the operands are aligned vertically.
</p>
<p><b>[d4e8ec69] 2021-12-03-08-53</b>: nested: to have combinations whose elements are themselves combinations.
</p>
<p><b>[4f640f70] 2021-12-03-08-52</b>: prefix notation: convention of placing operator to the left of the operands.
</p>
<p><b>[eb7bdf99] 2021-12-03-08-52</b>: operand: the other elements following the operator.
</p>
<p><b>[5fefc499] 2021-12-03-08-51</b>: operator: the leftmost element in the list.
</p>
<p><b>[6eac2bec] 2021-12-03-08-51</b>: combinations: expressions in lisp formed by delimiting a list of expression within parentheses in order to denote procedure application.
</p>
<p><b>[b65c0ef8] 2021-12-03-08-50</b>: you type an expression, and the interpreter responds by displaying the result of its evaluating that expression.
</p>
<p><b>[cd67834a] 2021-12-03-08-49</b>: means of abstraction: compound elements can be named and manipulated as units
</p>
<p><b>[532c2c17] 2021-12-03-08-48</b>: means of combination: compound elements are built from simpler ones.
</p>
<p><b>[cd16f788] 2021-12-03-08-48</b>: primitive expression: the simplest entities the language is concerned with.
</p>
<p><b>[daa4b884] 2021-12-03-08-47</b>: created the @glossary label today. the idea here is to define keywords and use this tag.
