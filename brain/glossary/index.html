</p>
<p><b>ALU</b>: arithmetic logic unit.
</p>
<p><b>Amdahl's Law</b>: states that when increasing the speed of one part of the system, the effect on the overall system performance depends on both how significant this part was and how much it sped up.
</p>

</p>
<p><b>imperative descriptions</b>: how-to descriptions. computer scientists are usually concerned with this (vs "what is").
</p>
<p><b>imperitive programming</b>: programming that makes extensive use of assignment. (SICP)
</p>
<p><b>iterative process</b>: a process whose state can be summarized by a fixed number of state variables, together with a fixed rule that describes how the state variables should be updated as the process moves from state to state and an optional end test that specifies conditions under which the process should terminate.
</p>
<p><b>lifetimes</b>: a generic in Rust that ensure that references are valid as long as they are needed to be.
</p>
<p><b>linear iterative process</b>: an interative process whose growth is linear.

</p>
<p><b>means of abstraction</b>: compound elements can be named and manipulated as units
</p>
<p><b>means of combination</b>: compound elements are built from simpler ones.
</p>
<p><b>memory hierarchy</b>: the way a computer system organizes memory by performance. moving from top to bottom, devices become slower, larger, and less costly per byte.
</p>
<p><b>message passing</b>: a style of programming found in languages such as LISP/Scheme which involve the ability to manipulate procedures as objects (which automatically provies the ability to represent compound data).
</p>
<p><b>modules (rust)</b>: thing that organizes code within a crate into groups for readability and easy reuse.
</p>
<p><b>monomorphization</b>: the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled.

<p><b>operator</b>: the leftmost element in the list.
</p>
<p><b>order of growth</b>: a notion used to describe the rate at which a process consumes computational resources. This is obtained via the gross measure of resources required by a process as the inputs become larger.

<p><b>procedure definitions</b>: a compound operation that can be given a name and then referred as a unit.
</p>
<p><b>process</b>: the operating system's abstraction for a running program.
</p>
<p><b>processor-memory gap</b>: the growing gap between processor and memory performance. as semiconductor technology progresses over the years, this gap continues to increase.

</p>
<p><b>trait</b>: similar to interfaces in other languages, a mechanism used in Rust that tells the Rust compiler about the functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. Can be used to define shared behavior in an abstract way.
</p>
<p><b>tree recursion</b>: a common pattern of computation. A recursive process whose evolution looks like a tree. in (<a href="/brain/SICP">SICP</a>), the fibonacci algorithm is used as an example of a process with tree recursion.
