<title>Ink</title>
<h1>Ink</h1>
<p>Part of my notetaking process involves writing things by
hand using pen and paper.
</p>
<p>Pages are scanned using a portable wand scanner (using
the low-res setting), and then
they are scaled and rotated using imagemagick:
</p>
<pre><code>rotcc ()
{
    IN=$1
    OUT=$2

    convert $IN -resize 50% -rotate -90 $OUT
}

rot ()
{
    IN=$1
    OUT=$2

    convert $IN -resize 50% -rotate 90 $OUT
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Pages are saved as JPG files.
</p>
<p>A single page can be
imported with the command <code>u/ink_import</code>. Inks are saved
to their own SQLar archive, then imported into the Zet
as a <code>Crate</code> item. 
</p>
<p><code>u/ink_import_all</code> will import all files in a given
directory with a ".jpg" extension.
</p>
<p><code>u/ink_import_filelist</code> will read from a list of files
instead of a directory. The important distinction here
is that <b>files in the list will be linked together</b> as
continguous pages.
</p>
<p>Once imported, a zetdo task to review inked page is
automatically created. This is done as a way to remind
myself to revisit old ideas and brainstorms (a process I refer
to as <code>creative reinforcement</code>).
</p>
<p>To see pages for review, running "tagged ink" should be
good enough. To see the next two pgaes on deck, run
<code>u/next_ink_todo</code>.
