<h1>SICP logs</h1>
<p><b>[c63fb9f2] 2021-12-03-10-43</b>: 1.3: computing cubes vs the ability to express the concept of cubing. I like that kind of distinction.
</p>
<p><b>[8bfaceec] 2021-12-03-10-25</b>: it seems that orders of growth can measure things in <code>steps</code> (time) and <code>space</code>. recursive factorial required O(N) in steps and space. iterative factorial was O(N) in steps, O(1) in space. I never considered space before.
</p>
<p><b>[5c4fd45e] 2021-12-03-10-20</b>: order of growth: a notion used to describe the rate at which a process consumes computational resources. This is obtained via the gross measure of resources required by a process as the inputs become larger.
</p>
<p><b>[50275e78] 2021-12-03-10-18</b>: the "counting change" problem smells like a dynamic programming problem. something I am very inexperienced at. worth looking at more closely.
</p>
<p><b>[60a162f4] 2021-12-03-10-17</b>: tree recursion: a common pattern of computation. A recursive process whose evolution looks like a tree. in (<a href="/brain/SICP">SICP</a>), the fibonacci algorithm is used as an example of a process with tree recursion.
</p>
<p><b>[5e49582e] 2021-12-03-10-14</b>: note to self: excercise 1.9 is worth working out by hand at some point.
</p>
<p><b>[78e125e0] 2021-12-03-10-12</b>: there's a difference between a recursive <code>procedure</code> and a recursive <code>process</code>. A recursive procedure is only syntactical self-referential. recursive process talks more about pattern of evolution.
</p>
<p><b>[2d39add0] 2021-12-03-10-09</b>: iterative processes does not grow and shrink the way recursive processes do.
</p>
<p><b>[df8a770b] 2021-12-03-10-09</b>: linear iterative process: an interative process whose growth is linear.
</p>
<p><b>[3213c89c] 2021-12-03-10-07</b>: iterative process: a process whose state can be summarized by a fixed number of state variables, together with a fixed rule that describes how the state variables should be updated as the process moves from state to state and an optional end test that specifies conditions under which the process should terminate.
</p>
<p><b>[8d060b80] 2021-12-03-10-05</b>: linear recursive process: a recursive process that keeps track of a chain of deferred operations. This chain has linear growth.
</p>
<p><b>[df9039dd] 2021-12-03-10-04</b>: recursive process: a process defined by a chain of deferred operations.
</p>
<p><b>[0dec860e] 2021-12-03-10-04</b>: deferred operations: in recursion, operations that are created while a process expands an expression, and are performed during the contraction.
