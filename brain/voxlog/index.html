<title>Voxlog</title>
<h1>Voxlog</h1>
<p>Audio recordings of me talking to myself. Yup. I'm doing
it.
</p>
<p>low bitrate mp3 files are recorded and named, and then
managed via a crate. These files are tagged under the
voxlog group. Hopefully I will set up a review process
that listens to these then takes notes, probably in a
<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a> format.
</p>
<p>You can review things in mplayer quickly with:
</p>
<pre><code>mplayer -af scaletempo -speed 2.0 foo.mp3</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This will play at 2x speed while preserving pitch.
