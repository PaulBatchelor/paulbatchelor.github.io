<h1>Voxlog</h1>

<h2>What is a Voxlog?</h2>

<p>Audio recordings of me talking to myself. Yup. I'm doing
it.
</p>
<p>low bitrate mp3 files are recorded and named, and then
managed via a crate. These files are tagged under the
voxlog group. Hopefully I will set up a review process
that listens to these then takes notes, probably in a
<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a> format.
</p>

<h2>Play Stuff Quickly with Mplayer</h2>

<p>You can review things in mplayer quickly with:
</p>
<pre><code>mplayer -af scaletempo -speed 2.0 foo.mp3</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This will play at 2x speed while preserving pitch.
</p>

<h2>A general procedure</h2>

<p>Use <code>u/voxlog_import</code> to import audio files. In addition
to creating an entry for the file, it will also create a
zetdo task to review the file.
</p>
<p>Reviewing at the moment means taking notes in
the <a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a> format. I've found this requires a
few passes of listening. The first pass is listening to
the whole thing without notes (this can be done around 2x
speed or so). The second review is when you take notes.
Extract the meaningful ideas and the well articulated bits.
Forget abou the rest.
</p>
<p>Once the zetdoc has been imported, add a blurb to the UUID
generated from it. Link that UUID to the audio file (which
can be found from the task's UUID via <code>u/linked_files</code>.
