<title>Speech Production and Speech Modelling</title>
<h1>Speech Production and Speech Modelling</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A 1990 collection of articles edited by William J. Hardcastle
and Alain Marchal. (UUID gwddoqdq)
</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in this to learn more about
articulatory synthesis.
</p>

<h2>Section 1: Physiological Framework</h2>

<p>Might be good to look at, but physiology only is so
interesting to me.
</p>

<h2>Section 2: Coarticulation</h2>

<p>Only two articles here.
</p>

<h2>Section 3: Models of Articulatory-Acoustic Relationships</h2>

<p>This is the meat of what I'm interested in.
</p>
<p>Articles that are specifically interesting to me:
</p>
<p>Ariticulatory Synthesis
by Celia Scully
</p>
<p>Articulatory-Acoustic realtionships in Fricative Consonants
by Christine H. Shadle
</p>
<p>Articulatory-Acoustic Phonetic Relations and Modelling,
Regions and Modes by R. Carre and M. Mrayati
</p>

<h2>Section 4: Theories/Models of Articulatory Organization and Timing</h2>

<p>"Speech as Audible Gestures" is one that sticks out to me,
because of the word "Gesture"
</p>

<b>[74774649] 2023-06-21-15-33</b>: wait, lenghts are more precise in the text: L/10, L/15, 2L/15, L/5, L/5, 2L/15, L/15, L/10.
</p>
<p><b>[33f3650c] 2023-06-21-15-32</b>: Distinct Region Model DRM, approximate region sizes from figure (pg 226): A is ~2cm, B ~1cm, D ~3.5cm. Regions go ABCDDCBA. total sum is 17cm.
</p>
<p><b>[30bea9ef] 2022-01-24-17-33</b>: next chapter I'll be skimming: articulatory-acoustic relationships in fricative consonants. like before, I'll be reading and scribbling notes, then writing my thoughts.
</p>
<p><b>[8d58f872] 2022-01-24-17-32</b>: also, the writing was very dry and research-y. if this is what it's going to be like generally, this book is going to be a slog.
</p>
<p><b>[2b91ea75] 2022-01-24-17-31</b>: finished the general chapter on articulatory synthesis. it turns out, AS can be quite analogue with no computers involved. it can also be purely about analysis: breaking speech into physiological components. so, good background, but not immediately helpful for my musical needs.
</p>
<p><b>[79f51a01] 2022-01-11-15-26</b>: diving into articulatory article. I've been taking notes, will probably transcribe into this zet after I'm done read-skimming this.
</p>
<p><b>[c9333f81] 2022-01-11-15-16</b>: Just flipped to the articulatory synthesis article by celia scully. scully, in 1990, was ad the department of linguistics and phonetics at the University of Leeds.
