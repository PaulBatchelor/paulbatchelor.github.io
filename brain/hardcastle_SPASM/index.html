<h1>Speech Production and Speech Modelling</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A 1990 collection of articles edited by William J. Hardcastle
and Alain Marchal.
</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in this to learn more about
articulatory synthesis.
</p>

<h2>Section 1: Physiological Framework</h2>

<p>Might be good to look at, but physiology only is so
interesting to me.
</p>

<h2>Section 2: Coarticulation</h2>

<p>Only two articles here.
</p>

<h2>Section 3: Models of Articulatory-Acoustic Relationships</h2>

<p>This is the meat of what I'm interested in.
</p>
<p>Articles that are specifically interesting to me:
</p>
<p>Ariticulatory Synthesis
by Celia Scully
</p>
<p>Articulatory-Acoustic realtionships in Fricative Consonants
by Christine H. Shadle
</p>
<p>Articulatory-Acoustic Phonetic Relations and Modelling,
Regions and Modes by R. Carre and M. Mrayati
</p>

<h2>Section 4: Theories/Models of Articulatory Organization and Timing</h2>

<p>"Speech as Audible Gestures" is one that sticks out to me,
because of the word "Gesture"
