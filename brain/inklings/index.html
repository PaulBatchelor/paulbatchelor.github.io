<title>Inklings</title>
<h1>Inklings</h1>
<p>Part of my note-taking system involves writing things
by hand in <a href="/brain/ink">ink</a>. After that, they are scanned
and processed manually, allowing me to briefly
review ideas and concepts for a second time.
</p>
<p>Some of these pages get set with a "blurb", or a
brief description of what the content of the ink is.
The ones that do get a blurb are displayed in the table
below.
</p>
<p>Note: only the blurbs and metadata
are displayed, not the pages themselves.
</p>
<p>Note: Timestamps are when the particular ink was imported
into the database. Typically this is a bulk operation, so
several will have very similar times. It still gives
reasonably helpful chronology, so I am including it in
the table.
</p>
