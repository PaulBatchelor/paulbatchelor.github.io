<title>Bibtex Notes</title>
<h1>Bibtex Notes</h1>
<p>Casual notes on BibTex, so I don't forget.
</p>
<p>With any luck, this actual org file is contained
in a folder called <code>bibtex</code>.
</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I have created an initial
janet script called <code>bibgen.janet</code> that generates
a bibtex file from my sqlite table and writes it to
standard output.
</p>
<p>Go into the bibtex folder (assuming I don't move this)
and run it like this:
</p>
<pre><code>weewiki janet bibgen.janet &gt; test.bib</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This will redirect standard output to <code>test.bib</code>.
</p>
<p>There should be a script in the <code>bibtex</code> folder called
<code>test.sh</code>, run that script to generate a test pdf which
should generate the entire bibliography. It is also worth
looking at the script itself. Both tex and bibtex apparently
need to be run twice in order to update the backlinks
properly.
