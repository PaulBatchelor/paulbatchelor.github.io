<h1>Rust Log</h1>
<p>A log of various messages in my zet tagged <code>rust</code>.
</p>
<p><b>[35e30f3c] 2022-01-04-15-08</b>: officially started my rust journey yesterday with the rust book. thankfully, my Alpine system was able to use the latest Rust builds just fine. No glibc issues, probably because they embed or don't use it.
</p>
<p><b>[558bf9d9] 2021-12-06-15-40</b>: created a rust group, to talk about the general topic of the rust programming language.
