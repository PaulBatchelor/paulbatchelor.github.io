<title>Rust Log</title>
<h1>Rust Log</h1>
<p>A log of various messages in my zet tagged <code>rust</code>.
</p>
<p><b>[037aefd1] 2022-02-05-14-46</b>: "violation of memory safety"
</p>
<p><b>[46c4e62b] 2022-02-05-14-45</b>: does rust make implicit calls to malloc (or equivalent)? thinking about realtime performance. does one have to be mindful of this?
</p>
<p><b>[5c367ac9] 2022-02-05-14-40</b>: finished reading about lifetimes in chapter 10, thus concluding chapter 10. circling back and reviewing.
</p>
<p><b>[2197880c] 2022-01-31-14-17</b>: lifetimes: a generic in Rust that ensure that references are valid as long as they are needed to be.
</p>
<p><b>[191ab8cb] 2022-01-31-14-14</b>: blanket implementations: implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait bounds.
</p>
<p><b>[9e4d3468] 2022-01-31-14-11</b>: trait bound: a special form in Rust that is used when traits are parameters. It's a long form, and often there's synactic sugar for it "impl Trait".
</p>
<p><b>[9348ce70] 2022-01-31-14-08</b>: traits apparently are like interfaces in other languages, not that I use many high-level languages. But I do seem to recall Go having something called interfaces that were very similar to Traits.
</p>
<p><b>[28c5f9a0] 2022-01-31-13-52</b>: Rust traits seem very much the thing to use if I want to implement something similar to the node interface I wrote for graforge in C.
</p>
<p><b>[35649cf0] 2022-01-31-13-49</b>: it's interesting to know that there's no performance overhead in using generics. I've heard that compilation times are slow though, so I wonder if there's a penalty there?
</p>
<p><b>[e6513dac] 2022-01-31-13-44</b>: I guess "impl" was used already in chapter 5 when implementing methods in structs. I clearly have forgotten that already.
</p>
<p><b>[da18bfe2] 2022-01-31-13-43</b>: Generics in Enums are a little bit strange to me. I'm really used to C Enums. Giving them types all of a sudden confuses me.
</p>
<p><b>[0f569073] 2022-01-31-13-36</b>: The generics chapter is a pretty meaty chapter. Found my way up to lifetimes, and thought it was a good time to review and re-read my scribbles.
</p>
<p><b>[9b810c9b] 2022-01-11-15-11</b>: to look up items in a module tree, rust employs both <b>relative</b> and <b>absolute</b> paths. <b>absolute</b> is done using a crate name or the literal <code>crate</code>. A relative path starts from the current path and uses <code>self</code>, <code>super</code>, or an identifier in the current module.
</p>
<p><b>[b103efb5] 2022-01-11-15-07</b>: modules nest. huh. interesting.
</p>
<p><b>[4370bd89] 2022-01-11-15-04</b>: create a new library restaurant: <code>cargo new --lib restaurant</code>.
</p>
<p><b>[35e30f3c] 2022-01-04-15-08</b>: officially started my rust journey yesterday with the rust book. thankfully, my Alpine system was able to use the latest Rust builds just fine. No glibc issues, probably because they embed or don't use it.
</p>
<p><b>[558bf9d9] 2021-12-06-15-40</b>: created a rust group, to talk about the general topic of the rust programming language.
