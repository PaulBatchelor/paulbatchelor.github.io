<h1>The Brain</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This is the <code>brain</code>. A collection of annotated articles
related to fields I want to study, managed via weewiki.
</p>
<p>My <a href="/brain/now">now</a> page will summarize what I've been
recently doing (assuming I update it).
</p>
<p>A list of all pages can be found at the
<a href="#">wiki_index</a>.
</p>
<p>General logs can be found at the <a href="/brain/logs">logs</a> page.
</p>

<h2>Now</h2>

<p>As of writing, I have been skimming through <a href="/brain/SICP">SICP</a>.
</p>
<p>I have also begun my journey with the <a href="/brain/rust">rust</a>programming language. I am working my way through the
<a href="/brain/rustbook">Rust Book</a>.
</p>
<p>Also trying to get into the habit of making a <a href="/brain/glossary">glossary</a>.
It's just a group I tag messages in at the moment, but my hope
is to add more structure to it.
