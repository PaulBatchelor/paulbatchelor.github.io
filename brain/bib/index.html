<title>Bib</title>
<h1>Bib</h1>
<p>This zettelkasten has a focus towards academic research,
so there is a special utility for managing resources
called bib.
</p>
<p>This will go over how to manage bib.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, references are managed in a SQLite
table, with fields matching ones you'd commonly find in
a bibtex file. The idea behind this is you could use
this interface to then generate bibtex to use in papers.
</p>
<p>As of writing, the way I've been importing stuff into this
database has been a very sloppy process involving a  Janet
script called <code>bib.janet</code>. This has a function called <code>sqlize</code>which is used to generate a SQLite INSERT statement.
My process right
now involves finding a bibtex entry, pasting it into the
file, and then manually converting all the fields to be
a janet table.
</p>
<p>Running the program with vanilla Janet writes SQLite
code to standard output, which can then be used with
the sqlite3 CLI like so:
</p>
<pre><code>janet bib.janet | sqlite3 a.db</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This zet also has a table that manages links between references
(via their unique keyword), and the UUIDs as they exist
in the <a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>.
