<h1>DSP in Rust</h1>
<p>A list of resources related to (audio) DSP.
</p>

<h2>Are We Audio Yet?</h2>

<p><a href="https://areweaudioyet.com/">https://areweaudioyet.com/</a></p>
<p>Rust commonly has these "Are We Something Yet?" websites.
This is the one for audio. <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Areweyet">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Areweyet</a></p>
<p>Contains links of projects related to rust and audio.

WeirdConstructor has been building a modular
synthesizer in Rust centered around a hexagonal
grid. This I believe is the underlying DSP library
used, called <code>HexoDSP</code></p>
<p>At this point there seems to be several nodes
implemented:

<p>On initial glance, this codebase looks very "rusty" to
me, so it's hard to for me to grok currently. It seems
that the graph interface and the DSP algorithms are
melted together, which obfuscates things.

<h2>freeverb-rs (Ian Hobson)</h2>

<p>Ian Hobson ported a version of freeverb to Rust:
</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/irh/freeverb-rs">https://github.com/irh/freeverb-rs</a></p>
<p>I mainly spent time looking at the core freeverb
implementation, which was just the DSP code with
a tick function. Similar to soundpipe/sndkit.
</p>
<p>This bit of code was reasonably straight-forward to read,
and looked similar to what would happen in equivalent C++
code.
</p>
<p>A few noteworthy things here: the code makes use of
vectors instead of arrays. There may be some performance
issues here. It may also be possible that this is allocated
onto the stack rather than the heap, which can eventually
be problematic.

<h2>Daisy BSP</h2>

<p>This shows examples of Rust being run on the Daisy Board,
with some DSP code as well:
</p>

<p>It seems the only thing implemented at the moment is a table
lookup oscillator.

<h2>Synthesizer-io (Ralph Linus)</h2>

<p>Seems to be an abandoned project for the most part?
</p>

<h2>Heap allocation via Box</h2>

<p>By default, Rust allocates things onto the stack, rather
than the Heap. This is a problem for DSP algorithms,
especially ones that require large buffers.
</p>
<p>Heap allocation can be done usine <code>Box</code>:

Provides some primitives.
