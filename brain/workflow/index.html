<p><b>[90ba052d] 2023-01-31-09-21</b>: article on "folders with high file counts" rresonates with me as I think about some of the organization strategies I have been developing. <a href="https://bombich.com/blog/2023/01/18/folders-high-file-counts">https://bombich.com/blog/2023/01/18/folders-high-file-counts</a>

<p><b>[4477ec94] 2022-11-20-15-19</b>: the Gibson on hackers.town is thinking about this. "I'm trying a completely different thing for my workstation... similar performance to the threadripper.... uses way less power." <a href="https://store.minisforum.com/products/b550">https://store.minisforum.com/products/b550</a>

<p><b>[e337e7c9] 2022-08-21-15-32</b>: I just finished reading a book and took lots of notes. Now what? <a href="https://writing.bobdoto.computer/question-i-just-finished-reading-a-book-and-took-lots-of-notes-now-what/">https://writing.bobdoto.computer/question-i-just-finished-reading-a-book-and-took-lots-of-notes-now-what/</a>

<p><b>[5929b207] 2022-07-17-10-00</b>: Pages as units of thought. 
</p>
<p><b>[1077c096] 2022-07-17-10-00</b>: Physical boundaries of the page can shape the way an idea is developed. 
</p>
<p><b>[c55a232d] 2022-07-17-10-00</b>: Writing down idea in notebook constricts the idea to a rectangular region. Must be able to articulate the idea in this area. Make it fit on a page, or break it up into multiple pages. 
</p>
<p><b>[3e103b64] 2022-07-17-10-00</b>: Act of writing takes some time to (compared to typing) this has to be factored in when writing a page. 
</p>
<p><b>[eeaa56b0] 2022-07-17-10-00</b>: Therefore, writing an idea down is a process that binds it to both time (handwriting) and space (the area of the page). 
</p>
<p><b>[57876724] 2022-07-17-10-00</b>: Process of evolving an idea using pages: start with a small page (notebook) for low friction kernels of an idea. Then, take it to a larger piece of paper (journal). Write the kernel in big letters, and write more things around it, allow the idea to grow into the new space. 
</p>
<p><b>[1bbf44b7] 2022-07-17-10-00</b>: After an idea is written on a page, it can be digitized and linked to the zettelkasten. This allows the idea to connect to larger ideas that have been developed over a longer period of time. Zets are nonlinear, time is staggered. 
</p>
<p><b>[26f4caee] 2022-07-17-09-23</b>: Scans page-by-page rather thank as a group. Perhaps this will influence the way I take notes? Not grouping things by physical book is probably for the best. Once they are digitized and in the zet, the book is basically arbitrary. 
</p>
<p><b>[320b748a] 2022-07-17-09-23</b>: Apprehensions about changing notetaking style to accomodate the scanner. 
</p>
<p><b>[8bcd8316] 2022-07-06-10-20</b>: create a (<a href="/brain/workflow">workflow</a>) page.
</p>
<p><b>[efb8a754] 2022-07-06-10-18</b>: when transcribing things for (<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>), I'm thinking I may chunk things in units of 1-2 pages at a time. There's something nice about preserving that physical division.
</p>
<p><b>[f2a1717e] 2022-05-25-09-32</b>: just kidding. chapter 10 was handwritten as well. it looks like I started chapter 11 on 5/11 and finished on the 5/23. 12 days of reading and handwritten notes for ~45min a day.
</p>
<p><b>[89e3c564] 2022-05-21-10-54</b>: create page that outlines pen-and-paper to zetdoc workflow
</p>
<p><b>[b2375f99] 2022-05-04-09-46</b>: Another screen from waveshare. 7-inch Full-HD display with HDMI in. Also there's a nice-looking enclosure. haven't purchased it, but it looks pretty reasonable. <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/displays/7inch-fhd-monitor.htm">https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/displays/7inch-fhd-monitor.htm</a> 
</p>
<p><b>[3061f02e] 2022-05-04-09-46</b>: 7.8 inch e-ink display with HDMI in. I purchased this actually and am currently using it as my main display (Am used to workflows with tiny screens). <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/7.8inch-hdmi-e-paper.htm">https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/7.8inch-hdmi-e-paper.htm</a>.
