<h1>CV</h1>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>2015-2017 MA, Music (Music, Science, Technology) Stanford University
2010-2014 BM, Electronic Production and Design, Berklee College of Music
</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<p>2018: Microsoft Research Contractor.
</p>
<p>2017: Microsoft Research Internship.
</p>
<p>2016: Research and Development, QuBit Electronix.
</p>
<p>2014-15: Systems Administration Intern, Safari Books Online.
</p>
<p>2012: Tutor at Berklee College of Music for Audio
Programming, Max/MSP, and Csound.
</p>

<h2>Open Source Contributions</h2>


<h3>ElectroSmith Daisy (2019-2020)</h3>


<h3>LMMS (2017)</h3>

<p>LMMS stands for Linux MultiMedia Studio. It is a cross-platfom
digital audio workstation (DAW) for making electronic music. For LMMS, I 
implemented a Sean Costello reverberator as a native LMMS plugin. I also have 
made efforts to simplify the audio plugin development process for native
LMMS plugins.
</p>

<h3>AudioKit (2015-2017)</h3>

<p>AudioKit is an iOS audio framework for synthesis and
analysis. For AudioKit, I ported Soundpipe/Sporth to AudioKit, and helped to port 
STK plugins directly to AudioKit
</p>

<h3>Csound (2015)</h3>

<p>Csound is one of the oldest musical programming languages 
still active to this day. I implemented the Paulstretch opcode, 
based on the the extreme time stretching tool by Paul Nasca Octavian.
</p>

<h3>Faust (2014)**:</h3>

<p>FAUST is a function language for audio DSP that transpiles
to C, C++, ASM.js, and others. It is capable of writing to several standard plugin
formats, including VST, AU, LV2, LADSPA.  I updated the faust2csound script 
and architecture file for Csound 6.0, which targets Csound opcodes.
</p>

<h3>Qubit Electronics (2012)**:</h3>

<p>Assisted in the firmware development for 
the Qubit Nebulae: a Raspberry Pi and Csound Powered Model. I also did 
contract work and helped them build templates for PD. 
</p>
