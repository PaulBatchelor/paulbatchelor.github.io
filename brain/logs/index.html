<p><b>[a841c91f] 2024-03-02-11-07</b>: working on a zfs cheatsheet. writing as I go. (<a href="/brain/zfs">zfs</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[b0227045] 2024-03-01-07-04</b>: also, the javascript section is being added. I'm about halfway done with that as well. (<a href="/brain/dz/mdn/js">dz/mdn/js</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[05212029] 2024-03-01-07-03</b>: finally finished mdn_css1 after many months. the dagzet is being updated now (<a href="/brain/dz/mdn/css">dz/mdn/css</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[c3f36949] 2024-02-28-19-09</b>: Getting my code annotation stuff in dagzet working again: (<a href="/brain/dz/forth/konilo/ilo">dz/forth/konilo/ilo</a>) and (<a href="/brain/dz/misc/rpike_matcher">dz/misc/rpike_matcher</a>) are some initial examples though not a lot has been done at the time of writing this.
</p>
<p><b>[afb1e9f1] 2024-02-27-14-38</b>: experiments in just intonation (<a href="/brain/dz/sounds/just_intonation">dz/sounds/just_intonation</a>)

</p>
<p><b>[f6692bea] 2024-02-22-14-54</b>: uploaded photos of initial orphium light experiments to dagzet. order is mostly how I want it, but I still need to annotate most of it. (<a href="/brain/dz/orphium/proto/light">dz/orphium/proto/light</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[ae1d0e55] 2023-11-06-10-15</b>: initial import of my working dagzet is live (<a href="/brain/dz">dz</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[f2386ef9] 2023-11-02-10-11</b>: some (<a href="#">dagzet</a>) dogfooding notes. For ~9 hours of lectures, it takes ~3 hours to transcribe, or about 1/3 extra time. Not sure if that's good or bad yet.
</p>
<p><b>[f3195de3] 2023-10-12-11-05</b>: getting some timekeeping metrics into my workflow here. transparency feels nice: (<a href="/brain/daily">daily</a>), (<a href="/brain/tasks">tasks</a>), and (<a href="/brain/velocity">velocity</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[82152927] 2023-10-05-07-59</b>: I'm hoping to improve my notetaking workflow. The current approach is too slow and too much.
</p>
<p><b>[9e8a8979] 2023-10-05-07-58</b>: Since I last actively worked on this, I've been working on the Gestlings, where I've started some new workflows and more refined ways to keep track of time.
</p>
<p><b>[b9b1d500] 2023-10-05-07-57</b>: this october, I'm trying to get more serious with my so-called "STEM" studies. I'm trying to be a better software engineer.
</p>
<p><b>[f76f819e] 2023-07-17-15-20</b>: some curated resources on vocal synthesis (particularly physically based techniques and singing synthesis) (<a href="/brain/vocsyn_resources">vocsyn_resources</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[1de690d1] 2023-07-03-14-37</b>: I'm about halfway into this Doom Game Engine Black Book, so I figured I'd make a page for it: (<a href="/brain/gebbdoom">gebbdoom</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[2d5e4e76] 2023-06-15-15-14</b>: woops, looks like I did (<a href="/brain/brainfiles">brainfiles</a>) already, but just more lowlevel: (<a href="/brain/pdfs">pdfs</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[3ebf07d1] 2023-06-15-15-12</b>: Created a file listing for all brain PDF files: (<a href="/brain/brainfiles">brainfiles</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[0d608828] 2023-03-22-08-56</b>: Initial outline created for (<a href="/brain/WEWLC">WEWLC</a>) today.
</p>
<p><b>[a8b89b2f] 2023-01-29-12-56</b>: the year 2022 of ink has been mostly encapsulated. "thoughts and ideas" is complete. looks to be a little over 200 pages.
</p>
<p><b>[3f3d9c47] 2022-11-26-09-00</b>: finally updated my (<a href="/brain/now">now</a>) page after half a year. Things have slowed somewhat. I've shifted gears towards my own creative pursuits and research.
</p>
<p><b>[2fa2c58a] 2022-11-20-10-27</b>: not a lot of active work done here in a while. All my attention has been placed into a new project called (<a href="#">gestlings</a>), which aim to be studies in Sonic Gesture.
</p>
<p><b>[206aed57] 2022-09-27-08-19</b>: typed up my chapter 2 notes for (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>). A scanned page seems to be missing. Created a task for it (gausjphsq).
</p>
<p><b>[8c213a83] 2022-09-24-15-48</b>: I have moved in and set up my workstation. Getting back to work.
</p>
<p><b>[f94299f7] 2022-09-11-07-05</b>: added (<a href="/brain/ink">ink</a>) and (<a href="/brain/notebooks">notebooks</a>) pages today.
</p>
<p><b>[1906fbb8] 2022-07-17-15-00</b>: okay I think I fixed the incorrectly imported ink pages.
</p>
<p><b>[cc21e7b4] 2022-07-17-07-33</b>: Corrected by renaming <code>stacks_queues_deques</code> to <code>linear_lists</code>. the actualy section for <code>stacks_deques_queues</code> just won't have a label anymore (a new one can be made). This is acceptable.
</p>
<p><b>[8210bde5] 2022-07-17-06-32</b>: uh oh. I just realized that I've overloaded the stacksdeques tag for all of 2.2. Should have been linear lists. I think it's possible to salvage if I rename the label (UUID stays the same).
</p>
<p><b>[4d830dd9] 2022-07-11-19-38</b>: now that I have a full-time job, it doesn't make too much sense to do the (<a href="/brain/focuschips">focuschips</a>) system. At least, not the way I've been approaching it thus far. Taking a break from this.
</p>
<p><b>[8bcd8316] 2022-07-06-10-20</b>: create a (<a href="/brain/workflow">workflow</a>) page.
</p>
<p><b>[043b1238] 2022-07-02-09-27</b>: created a (<a href="/brain/pdfs">pdfs</a>) page to list all pdf documents I have in the database, with blurbs if they have them. Eventually I will want to add blurbs to all of them.
</p>
<p><b>[bb6df6d4] 2022-07-01-10-56</b>: new page related to (<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>): (<a href="/brain/zetdoc_index">zetdoc_index</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[ce27de87] 2022-06-30-14-25</b>: brain dump: (<a href="/brain/thoughts_on_gestured_sound">thoughts_on_gestured_sound</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[87b76de6] 2022-06-30-10-53</b>: editing my thoughts on gestured sound. tagging.
</p>
<p><b>[226f27e9] 2022-06-29-06-16</b>: transcribing notes I wrote in the lu/smith paper on glottal source modelling.
</p>
<p><b>[5daa68c0] 2022-06-28-10-19</b>: I never get a context to talk about this, but I just finished Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Volume 1). 6 months of reading 15 minutes a day.
</p>
<p><b>[ceca10d3] 2022-06-18-07-35</b>: All the notes for (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>) have been typed up now. I am now officially done reading the first half of this book.
</p>
<p><b>[fda7ac62] 2022-05-21-10-53</b>: added a much needed table of contents to (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>). a much needed thing now, considering how large the document has gotten.
</p>
<p><b>[4a6ac139] 2022-05-21-10-50</b>: oof. I'm already seeing some notes in (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>) getting messed up because of improper parsing. I really need to have tags for inline math mode TeX code, even if I don't intend to render it.
</p>
<p><b>[24015544] 2022-05-20-09-34</b>: taschenbegleiter has been ordered. hoo boy.
</p>
<p><b>[b7fb485e] 2022-05-11-09-35</b>: the (<a href="/brain/agenda">agenda</a>) page is complete. no support for subtasks. I don't use them enough to justify putting in the work to display them.
</p>
<p><b>[41de964a] 2022-05-10-20-41</b>: table arrived today, which was a nice surprise. I thought I wouldn't see that until a week or so. Strap comes Thursday. At that point, I'll be have a reading and notetaking setup for (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[4cc92e3d] 2022-05-10-09-54</b>: added initial (<a href="/brain/agenda">agenda</a>) page. it lists tasks, but no comments.
</p>
<p><b>[13ecc0e4] 2022-05-10-09-33</b>: now that my e-ink screen is dead, I'm switching to a more paper-based setup for note-taking. This sets me back for reading things like (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>) that are physical books because I don't have a stand for the books AND the notebook.
</p>
<p><b>[d79c6779] 2022-05-08-07-37</b>: The ribbon to my e-ink screen tore yesterday. Now, I'm rethinking my note-taking approach. I really like not having to look at a screen, so I'm attempting to try handwritten notes which then get typed up to my zet. More work, but maybe more information retention as well?
</p>
<p><b>[22220f68] 2022-05-05-09-43</b>: experimenting using this format with (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>). I think I may have mentioned this before.
</p>
<p><b>[53dd2b60] 2022-05-05-09-43</b>: in light of (<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>) actually existing, I've created a staging folder. This will contain zetdocs getting prepped/written to be imported.
</p>
<p><b>[f147969a] 2022-05-05-08-40</b>: added message counts to (<a href="/brain/labels">labels</a>) page.
</p>
<p><b>[c60beb39] 2022-05-04-09-49</b>: initial (<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>) implementation created. used it to import a backlog of links I curated over the past few months. New page can be found at (<a href="/brain/links">links</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[4f3bbdeb] 2022-04-29-10-25</b>: for (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>), going to try experimenting with how I take notes. will write something that will vaguely be the ideal syntax for a (<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>) staging document
</p>
<p><b>[4d8e420b] 2022-04-29-10-17</b>: created a new page: (<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>). For now, it is just a proposal.
</p>
<p><b>[3fe8bb87] 2022-04-29-10-12</b>: moving forward, I want to adopt a more granular form of note taking that isn't just writing sentences in an org document. I need an approach that takes advantage of the zet format more, and allows links and structures. I'm working out an idea called a zetdoc, which would allow one to type up notes in a linear way using a temporary staging document, then have that document be imported and parsed in the zet database with links.
</p>
<p><b>[dacd53de] 2022-04-24-14-40</b>: obviously, doing the problem sets would be ideal. The time and focus is intimidating. It almost feels derailing. Like diminished returns. It would be a good way to build up intuition. But I must choose my time wisely towards building intuition that will help me move forwards in my career and art.
</p>
<p><b>[c2cbcc4d] 2022-04-24-14-38</b>: It remains to be seen if "reading first, problem sets later" is an effective strategy. I am certainly cramming my head with a bunch of topics quickly. I'm wondering if I can apply this strategy towards some of the DSP books.
</p>
<p><b>[11a719f7] 2022-04-21-09-53</b>: ported a MIXAL program to C for the first time! It was the findmax program found on page 145 of volume 1 of (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>). A very short and simple program, but the process of translation was a helpful excercise. I ended up writing two versions: one closely following the original MIXAL structure using gotos, and then a reworked version that looks like more conventional C.
</p>
<p><b>[4741978e] 2022-04-20-09-51</b>: a good practice for me would be to try to implement this trivial findmax MIXAL program into C.
</p>
<p><b>[d3012b8f] 2022-04-20-09-44</b>: slowly understanding a trivial program written in (<a href="/brain/MIXAL">MIXAL</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[2c5607df] 2022-04-19-10-28</b>: finally getting around to a serious attempt at learning (<a href="/brain/MIX">MIX</a>) and (<a href="/brain/MIXAL">MIXAL</a>) in order to better study (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[e1e9841a] 2022-04-19-05-33</b>: my first (<a href="/brain/focuslog">focuslog</a>) entry that is late by a day. It was bound to happen. whenever I decide to crunch numbers, I'll have to factor that in.
</p>
<p><b>[ca194d75] 2022-04-13-09-34</b>: done with chapter 6. that finishes my requirements for (<a href="/brain/TYCS">TYCS</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[47c6f171] 2022-04-05-16-27</b>: added the pirkle book on building audio effect plugins
</p>
<p><b>[ebfc1bed] 2022-04-05-16-20</b>: Now that I'm close to finishing (<a href="/brain/CSAPP">CSAPP</a>), I'm starting on the next (<a href="/brain/TYCS">TYCS</a>) series book: (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>) (lots of acronyms here).
</p>
<p><b>[40ffe805] 2022-03-24-22-17</b>: (<a href="#">focuslogs</a>) so far have been a good streak, but I haven't done it for long. Now that I am waking up earlier to do reading, I seem to be getting through all my alotted tokens fairly quickly. If I can keep this up for another week or so consistently, I might try to add more tokens to the my daily mix. I did in fact reduce it slightly already because I was lagging behind initially.
</p>
<p><b>[cf567c6b] 2022-03-23-10-12</b>: create initial stub for (<a href="/brain/MIX">MIX</a>) page
</p>
<p><b>[10a3753e] 2022-03-22-06-30</b>: writing the (<a href="#">page</a>) page as I go. no more or minimal backtracking.
</p>
<p><b>[66e1733c] 2022-03-21-20-03</b>: just made a (<a href="/brain/palestrina">palestrina</a>) page and @palestrina group to help document my efforts in studying the renaissance composer.
</p>
<p><b>[c061632b] 2022-03-19-11-02</b>: beginning to sink my teeth into palestrina. There's a group that put out 8 volumes (8 hours) of palestrina music. currently downloading scores and following along. actual analysis will come later.
</p>
<p><b>[dd6e66f7] 2022-03-17-10-42</b>: turns out there's a lot of great information on the wikipedia page on locking: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)</a>.
</p>
<p><b>[753ab643] 2022-03-14-05-55</b>: trying to wake up earlier to read
</p>
<p><b>[d66f976f] 2022-03-11-10-11</b>: wow! mupdf supports epub formats. that's amazing!
</p>
<p><b>[a4a6986c] 2022-03-09-12-29</b>: zetdo does have a stopwatch feature. wonder if there's any usefulness here? could be a useful metric to have.
</p>
<p><b>[f73855c4] 2022-03-08-13-48</b>: gooseneck arrived! remarkable now can be read while I type on my e-ink display. it's all coming together now...
</p>
<p><b>[7cc741bf] 2022-03-08-13-21</b>: got an HMDI monitor the other day. mupdf works really well with it. It is small, but this could potentially mean more reading on my computer rather than my RM.
</p>
<p><b>[4af68e13] 2022-02-25-17-36</b>: added (<a href="/brain/labels">labels</a>) meta-page, that lists all the labels and some blurbs, if there is one.
</p>
<p><b>[e77b0650] 2022-02-07-15-19</b>: added some links today to the (<a href="/brain/rust_dsp">rust_dsp</a>) page. It seems like there is more that could be done.
</p>
<p><b>[d21382c5] 2022-01-28-16-55</b>: starting to make a page on glottal modelling: (<a href="/brain/glottal_flow_derivative">glottal_flow_derivative</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[572e916f] 2022-01-28-14-32</b>: lots of research into glottal modelling. hiu-ling "vicky" lu seems to have a good dissertation on this, and the pink trombone model is somewhat based on this.
</p>
<p><b>[a9fd28e8] 2022-01-24-18-07</b>: added a (<a href="/brain/fricatives">fricatives</a>) page. will also added a fricatives label as well.
</p>
<p><b>[bbcd6cb8] 2022-01-20-15-44</b>: okay updated fant paper to be 1985. all better.
</p>
<p><b>[10b72daa] 2022-01-20-15-40</b>: added fant 1985 paper on four parameter glottal model. note that I thought it was a 1980 paper, so the PDF is currently misnamed.
</p>
<p><b>[057cd20e] 2022-01-18-15-15</b>: initial proposal written up. see QMUL/prop.txt.
</p>
<p><b>[a50c24a1] 2022-01-13-16-59</b>: (<a href="/brain/PRC_dissertation">PRC_dissertation</a>) is blowing my mind. what an incredible resource on singing synthesis, that's been here the whole time.
</p>
<p><b>[4f932fc4] 2022-01-13-13-22</b>: the temporary workaround for the charging issue involved using a clamp to lift up to RM, leaving room at the bottom for the cable to go underneath. might want to consider a real tablet stand like the one I have for my laptop.
</p>
<p><b>[4b75b280] 2022-01-13-12-35</b>: annd the remarkable has low battery. this is an ongoing problem. I would love to figure out a better charging solution for this thing.
</p>
<p><b>[b5e4facc] 2022-01-12-16-10</b>: working on a new PhD proposal for QMUL AIM: (<a href="/brain/proposal_AIM">proposal_AIM</a>). Fingers crossed.
</p>
<p><b>[26e8258a] 2022-01-05-10-54</b>: just transfered the SQLar file to the local database. Note to self: it is 454M, so it takes a few moments.
</p>
<p><b>[50b4b507] 2022-01-05-09-50</b>: new pages added: (<a href="/brain/rust">rust</a>), (<a href="/brain/rustbook">rustbook</a>), (<a href="/brain/rustlog">rustlog</a>), etc. going to be very rusty in the months to come.
</p>
<p><b>[b4dd6d67] 2021-12-11-06-39</b>: really hoping that busting through a book the first time 'round without fully understanding everything is an okay approach. I want to think of it as map-building for the second time 'round.
</p>
<p><b>[86426de6] 2021-12-06-16-04</b>: added a (<a href="/brain/now">now</a>) page.
