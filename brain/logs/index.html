<p><b>[cf567c6b] 2022-03-23-10-12</b>: create initial stub for (<a href="#">MIX</a>) page
</p>
<p><b>[10a3753e] 2022-03-22-06-30</b>: writing the (<a href="#">page</a>) page as I go. no more or minimal backtracking.
</p>
<p><b>[66e1733c] 2022-03-21-20-03</b>: just made a (<a href="/brain/palestrina">palestrina</a>) page and @palestrina group to help document my efforts in studying the renaissance composer.
</p>
<p><b>[c061632b] 2022-03-19-11-02</b>: beginning to sink my teeth into palestrina. There's a group that put out 8 volumes (8 hours) of palestrina music. currently downloading scores and following along. actual analysis will come later.
</p>
<p><b>[dd6e66f7] 2022-03-17-10-42</b>: turns out there's a lot of great information on the wikipedia page on locking: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)</a>.
</p>
<p><b>[753ab643] 2022-03-14-05-55</b>: trying to wake up earlier to read
</p>
<p><b>[d66f976f] 2022-03-11-10-11</b>: wow! mupdf supports epub formats. that's amazing!
</p>
<p><b>[a4a6986c] 2022-03-09-12-29</b>: zetdo does have a stopwatch feature. wonder if there's any usefulness here? could be a useful metric to have.
</p>
<p><b>[f73855c4] 2022-03-08-13-48</b>: gooseneck arrived! remarkable now can be read while I type on my e-ink display. it's all coming together now...
</p>
<p><b>[7cc741bf] 2022-03-08-13-21</b>: got an HMDI monitor the other day. mupdf works really well with it. It is small, but this could potentially mean more reading on my computer rather than my RM.
</p>
<p><b>[4af68e13] 2022-02-25-17-36</b>: added (<a href="/brain/labels">labels</a>) meta-page, that lists all the labels and some blurbs, if there is one.
</p>
<p><b>[e77b0650] 2022-02-07-15-19</b>: added some links today to the (<a href="/brain/rust_dsp">rust_dsp</a>) page. It seems like there is more that could be done.
</p>
<p><b>[d21382c5] 2022-01-28-16-55</b>: starting to make a page on glottal modelling: (<a href="/brain/glottal_flow_derivative">glottal_flow_derivative</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[572e916f] 2022-01-28-14-32</b>: lots of research into glottal modelling. hiu-ling "vicky" lu seems to have a good dissertation on this, and the pink trombone model is somewhat based on this.
</p>
<p><b>[a9fd28e8] 2022-01-24-18-07</b>: added a (<a href="/brain/fricatives">fricatives</a>) page. will also added a fricatives label as well.
</p>
<p><b>[bbcd6cb8] 2022-01-20-15-44</b>: okay updated fant paper to be 1985. all better.
</p>
<p><b>[10b72daa] 2022-01-20-15-40</b>: added fant 1985 paper on four parameter glottal model. note that I thought it was a 1980 paper, so the PDF is currently misnamed.
</p>
<p><b>[057cd20e] 2022-01-18-15-15</b>: initial proposal written up. see QMUL/prop.txt.
</p>
<p><b>[a50c24a1] 2022-01-13-16-59</b>: (<a href="/brain/PRC_dissertation">PRC_dissertation</a>) is blowing my mind. what an incredible resource on singing synthesis, that's been here the whole time.
</p>
<p><b>[4f932fc4] 2022-01-13-13-22</b>: the temporary workaround for the charging issue involved using a clamp to lift up to RM, leaving room at the bottom for the cable to go underneath. might want to consider a real tablet stand like the one I have for my laptop.
</p>
<p><b>[4b75b280] 2022-01-13-12-35</b>: annd the remarkable has low battery. this is an ongoing problem. I would love to figure out a better charging solution for this thing.
</p>
<p><b>[b5e4facc] 2022-01-12-16-10</b>: working on a new PhD proposal for QMUL AIM: (<a href="/brain/proposal_AIM">proposal_AIM</a>). Fingers crossed.
</p>
<p><b>[26e8258a] 2022-01-05-10-54</b>: just transfered the SQLar file to the local database. Note to self: it is 454M, so it takes a few moments.
</p>
<p><b>[50b4b507] 2022-01-05-09-50</b>: new pages added: (<a href="/brain/rust">rust</a>), (<a href="/brain/rustbook">rustbook</a>), (<a href="/brain/rustlog">rustlog</a>), etc. going to be very rusty in the months to come.
</p>
<p><b>[b4dd6d67] 2021-12-11-06-39</b>: really hoping that busting through a book the first time 'round without fully understanding everything is an okay approach. I want to think of it as map-building for the second time 'round.
</p>
<p><b>[86426de6] 2021-12-06-16-04</b>: added a (<a href="/brain/now">now</a>) page.
</p>
<p><b>[b74496e2] 2021-12-06-16-02</b>: created (<a href="/brain/rust">rust</a>) page.
</p>
<p><b>[223a5d8e] 2021-12-06-15-58</b>: lots of infrastructure made today, including some work with (<a href="/brain/bib">bib</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[daa4b884] 2021-12-03-08-47</b>: created the @glossary label today. the idea here is to define keywords and use this tag.
</p>
<p><b>[1e89520e] 2021-12-02-15-32</b>: hello.
