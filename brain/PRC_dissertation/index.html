<h1>PRC Dissertation</h1>
<p>Thesis Title: Identification of Control Parameters
In An Articulatory Vocal Tract Model
With Applications To the Synthesis of Singing
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Outlines, notes, thoughts, on Perry Cook's
disseration on Singing Synthesis in 1991.
</p>

<h2>Abstract (Summary)</h2>

<p>"The synthesis fo singing is investigated using an
articulatory model which simulates the human vocal tract as
a network of digital filter simulations of acoustic tubes"
</p>
<p>(Love that succient definition).
</p>
<p>Presents methods for finding vocal tract shapes.
</p>
<p>A "new method for adaptively tracking vocal tract shape"
from an input signal.
</p>
<p>Glottal signal information is explored as well.
</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>Some choice bits.
</p>
<p>"Speech Organ"
</p>
<p>"flexible synthesis of music"
</p>
<p>digital filters simulate the "solutions of wave equations
inside acoustic tubes"
</p>
<p>"perturbations in the source signal are the primary
focus of the experimental research presented in this
dissertation"
</p>
<p>"computers most easily make irritating and boring sounds"
</p>
<p>"such systems sound like machines imitating speech"
</p>

<h2>Part 1: Synthesis of the Singing Voice</h2>

<p>There are many differences between speech and singing.
A bullet list of about 10 such differences are presented,
with source citations.
