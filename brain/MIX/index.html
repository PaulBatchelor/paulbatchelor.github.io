<h1>MIX</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>"MIX is the world's first polyunsaturated computer."
</p>
<p><code>MIX</code> is a hypothetical computer invented by Donald Knuth
for "The Art of Computer Programming".
</p>
<p><code>MIXAL</code> is the assembly lanuage used to write programs for
this computer system. See: <a href="/brain/MIXAL">MIXAL</a>.

<h2>Origins MIX name origin.</h2>

<p>MIX can also be interpreted as 1009 in Roman Numerals,
which is the identifying number of the computer.
</p>
<p>1009 was obtained by taking the average number of 16
contemporary machines that MIX architecture
could be reasonably emulated on (360, 650, 709, 7070,
U3, SS80, 1107, 1604, G20, B220, S2000, 920, 601, PDP-4,
II).
</p>

<h2>Word</h2>

<p>Basic unit of MIX is a byte. It must be capable of holding
at least 64 distinct values (6-bit). Programs expressed
in MIX are written with the assumption that bytes are no
more than 6-bits. Larger values can be expressed with
adjacent bytes.
</p>

<h2>Registers</h2>

<p>MIX has 9 registers: A, X, I1-6, and J.
</p>
<p>The A-register is the accumulator, consiting of five bytes
and a sign.
</p>
<p>The X-register is an extension, consisting of five
bytes and a sign.
</p>
<p>The I registers I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, and I6 are index
registers, that whole two bytes and a sign.
</p>
<p>The J-register is the Jump Regiseter, consisting of two
bytes and no sign component (it is always assumed
positive).
