(2024-03-23) So, Orphium is the name of a new project that I'm hoping to work on. I started jotting down a few ideas. At the time of writing, it's mostly a bunch of smaller components of things that interest me that I'm hoping to tie together into a cohesive narrative The name "orphium" actually comes from an idea I came up with a few years ago.

I designed a just intonation algorithm that could smoothly go between notes and could also allow you to change the base key continuously. Motivation for this was to attempt improve blending in vocal synthesizers. I have this theory that more often than not singers and fretless instruments will tune to something closer to just intonation than equal temperament when they are in an ensemble performing ringing chords.

(2024-03-23) So, in prepping for my upcoming travels to NYC, I had to think very carefully about what I could pack. There was only so much weight I could bring. The micromonitor and the stand added a non-trivial amount of weight. It was doable, but definitely at a cost, and I felt like I had to *earn* it. At the time of writing, I decided to bring the micromonitor on the journey. However, the cost was giving up the other speaker I bought specifically for this trip. It was just too bulky, heavy, and fragile. I also gave up the speaker stand which at 2.7 pounds was decent chunk to lug around.
