<title>Rust Book</title>
<h1>Rust Book</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Various notes and thoughts regarding the Rust Book.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: How to install rust</h2>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised that I could get things working
on Alpine without too much issue.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: hands-on intro to rust</h2>

<p>I intially skipped this, then went back just to get used
to building projects with cargo.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Rust features similar to other languages</h2>

<p>Yeah, this mostly felt familiar.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: Ownership</h2>

<p>I thought this was introduced pretty well. I have a feeling
that this will get tricky quickly in practice though. Already
it is having me re-think how I'd port some of the
functionality of graforge to Rust.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: Structs and Methods</h2>

<p>Reasonably familiar.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: Enums, Match, etc</h2>

<p>This kind of looks like a case switch if you squint. I've had
experience with pattern matching from FAUST, which I believe
is where it is heading. Will be interested to see what that
looks like.
</p>
<p>Overall, I feel like this is more powerful than it looks.
</p>
