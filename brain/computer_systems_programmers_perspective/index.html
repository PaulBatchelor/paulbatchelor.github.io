<p><b>[3d527d32] 2022-03-13-18-55</b>: these abbreviations are getting a little silly. looking at you, movz.
</p>
<p><b>[c81d894c] 2022-03-13-18-44</b>: this assembly chapter is starting to go into territory I don't know much about. A part of me thinks it would be wise to do the problem sets, but another part of me wants to keep reading.
</p>
<p><b>[38d1fd5a] 2022-03-13-18-43</b>: effective address: in assembly, this is the computed address used to access a particular part of memory.
</p>
<p><b>[59cd535d] 2022-03-13-18-42</b>: Operands in x86-64 have three types: immediate (for constant values), register (contents of a register), and memory (access a memory location).
</p>
<p><b>[89631152] 2022-03-13-18-38</b>: Figure 3.2 (Integer Registers) looks like a very helpful chart (pdf pg 473). The page before it has a good terse summary of all the register names and abbreviations.
</p>
<p><b>[6b9abe6e] 2022-03-13-18-35</b>: in GCC assembly code, the data movement instruction has 4 variants: <code>movb</code> (move byte), <code>movw</code> (move word), <code>movl</code> (move double word), and <code>movg</code> (move quad word).
</p>
<p><b>[303ed42f] 2022-03-09-16-30</b>: parity flag: in x86-64, a 1-bit flag that is set after an arithmetic or logical operation. PF is 1 when the lower 8 bits have an even number of 1s, 0 otherwise. This information is not directly accessible in C and requires machien-dependent assembly code.
</p>
<p><b>[4b50a996] 2022-03-09-16-25</b>: Intel uses the word "word" to describe a 16-bit data type. This is for historical reasons. Origins as a 16-bit architecture.
</p>
<p><b>[7de2489a] 2022-03-09-16-23</b>: it seems NOPs can be used for zero-padding for memory alignement. go figure.
</p>
<p><b>[8d9ff2bc] 2022-03-09-16-14</b>: the "-S" flag will generate the assembly file only and go no futher. Probnably should be used with "-Og" for learning purposes.
</p>
<p><b>[7ec9d86c] 2022-03-09-16-12</b>: register file: contains 16 named locations storing 64-bit values, able to hold addresses or integer data.
</p>
<p><b>[a803ab44] 2022-03-09-16-09</b>: ISA: instruction set architecture.
</p>
<p><b>[b9ec9347] 2022-03-09-16-08</b>: the "-Og" flag in GCC is used to produce machine code with the overall structure of the C code.
</p>
<p><b>[9af0424a] 2022-03-09-16-07</b>: linking handles filling in the address of global values in the object files
</p>
<p><b>[63477beb] 2022-03-09-16-05</b>: reading about instruction sets makes me want to take a peak at RISC-V. I wonder what it's like to learn compared to x86. It doesn't have the historical baggage, so maybe more elegant?
</p>
<p><b>[31abc336] 2022-03-09-16-01</b>: hyperthreading: a method to run two programs simultaneously on a single processor. First introduced in the x86 line with the Pentium 4E processor in 2004.
</p>
<p><b>[0c292a1e] 2022-03-09-15-18</b>: AMD: Advanced Micro Devices.
</p>
<p><b>[f19cf5a8] 2022-03-09-15-18</b>: These intros are very lecture-like.
</p>
<p><b>[03376f12] 2022-03-09-15-17</b>: "Those who say 'I understand the general principles, I don't want to bother learning the details' are deluding themselves". Jesus. Little sore much?
</p>
<p><b>[494ceb1c] 2022-03-09-15-11</b>: starting chapter 3 now: machine level representations of programs
</p>
<p><b>[be268d80] 2022-02-03-14-51</b>: this chapter has concepts that are pretty familiar to me after my years of writing C. I'm skimming this more quickly until I find things that look unfamiliar. Maybe IEEE floating point gets introduced here? I could always stand to learn more about that.
</p>
<p><b>[614aa6a5] 2022-02-03-14-50</b>: the math equations in chapter 2 seem to be typeset incorrectly half of the time. And when they are typeset correctly, it looks terrible and confusing.
</p>
<p><b>[f91aa55d] 2022-01-24-17-25</b>: I like this, as it is relevant to my bitmap glyph live coding project: In isolation, a single bit is not very useful. When we group bits together and apply some interpretation that gives meaning to the different possible bit patterns, however, we can represent the elements of any finite set.
</p>
<p><b>[cda51c27] 2022-01-24-17-23</b>: okay. onto chapter 2 now.
</p>
<p><b>[1c52374f] 2022-01-24-17-18</b>: Finished chapter 1. Reviewing before moving on to chapter 2: representing and manipulating information.
</p>
<p><b>[e24ecde1] 2022-01-24-17-18</b>: getting my act together with the CSAPP page (which, I regrettably chose a very long name for. oh well).
</p>
<p><b>[22c8adad] 2022-01-13-13-18</b>: Amdahl's Law: states that when increasing the speed of one part of the system, the effect on the overall system performance depends on both how significant this part was and how much it sped up.
</p>
<p><b>[126d5e28] 2022-01-13-13-14</b>: file: a sequence of bytes. nothing more. nothing less.
</p>
<p><b>[9c8481a4] 2022-01-13-13-12</b>: virtual address space: a uniform view of memory that each process has.
</p>
<p><b>[aca1e54c] 2022-01-13-13-12</b>: virtual memory: an abstraction that provides each process with the illusion that it has exclusive use of the main memory.
</p>
<p><b>[245122be] 2022-01-13-13-08</b>: context: the state information that the process needs in order to run.

</p>
<p><b>[2a73cc20] 2022-01-12-17-44</b>: memory hierarchy: the way a computer system organizes memory by performance. moving from top to bottom, devices become slower, larger, and less costly per byte.
</p>
<p><b>[832ac8d8] 2022-01-12-17-42</b>: locality: the tendency for programs to access data and code in localized regions.
</p>
<p><b>[81d52e86] 2022-01-12-17-40</b>: L2 cache: cache that is larger than L1 cache, with hundreds of thousands to millions of bytes and is connected to the processor by a special bus. It can be 5x slower than the L1 cache.
</p>
<p><b>[c9f8fa63] 2022-01-12-17-39</b>: L1 cache: Cache that tens of thousands of bytes long, and can be accesed nearly as fast at the register file.
</p>
<p><b>[a8f04ba6] 2022-01-12-17-38</b>: cache memory is used to deal with the processor-memory gap
</p>
<p><b>[0a1352f0] 2022-01-12-17-37</b>: it is easier and cheaper to make processors run faster than it is to make memory run faster.
</p>
<p><b>[28deebd5] 2022-01-12-17-37</b>: processor-memory gap: the growing gap between processor and memory performance. as semiconductor technology progresses over the years, this gap continues to increase.

</p>
<p><b>[ed4c1eaa] 2022-01-09-13-44</b>: just skimmed TOC. there's a lot of ground covered here. (<a href="/brain/TYCS">TYCS</a>) recommends the first part at leaast (1-6). But the other parts seem useful. We shall see what the content is like though.
</p>
<p><b>[f979bfa8] 2022-01-09-13-41</b>: the label @CSAPP will be used for anything related to (<a href="/brain/computer_systems_programmers_perspective">computer_systems_programmers_perspective</a>).
