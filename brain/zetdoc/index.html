<h1>ZetDoc</h1>
<p>The <code>ZetDoc</code> is a proposal for a format that would
allow a document-like structure to exist inside of
a zettelkasten. One would write initial notes in
a temporary staging document, where it would then
be parsed into entries inside of a weewiki zettelkasten
with ties to tags. One zet entry would be a representation
of the original document represented as a JSON document
with links. A program could parse this and then
dynamically reconstruct the document.
</p>
<p>Motivation: to make information more granular and connected.
