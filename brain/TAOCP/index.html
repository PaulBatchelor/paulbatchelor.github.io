<h2>Chapter 2: Information Structures</h2>


<h3>2.2 Linear Lists</h3>

<p>Data usually has much more structural data than we actually want to represent directly in a computer.  [gpuolfjer]
</p>
<p>Consider not only the data structure, but the class of operations to be done on the data.  [gfawddqwk]
</p>
<p>Linear List: sequence of nodes whose essential structure properties involve only the relative positions between items as they appear in a line.  [gpddodpju]
</p>
<p>Linear List Operations: Access, Insert, Delete, Combine, Split, Copy (List), Get Number Of Nodes, Sort, Search.  [guwwkfilp]
</p>
<p>Linear List Types: Stack: insert/delete at end of list, Queue: Insertions made at one end, deletions made at the other end, Deque: insert/delete at both ends.  [gkwwskdla]
</p>
<p>A deque is more general than a stack or queue.  [gdhlrslwo]
</p>
<p>Stacks are particularly useful for the processing of languages with a nested structure.  [gadqiousq]
</p>
<p>What is a Schachtelsatze? (!TAOCP vol1, pg 241).  [gurrlfdfu]
</p>
<p>Stacks generally occur most frequently in connection with explicitly or implicitly recursive algorithms.  [gukeuflup]
</p>
<p>Kind of like how the book references chapters that haven't been published yet. Long term thinking indeed.  [gpadakoqp]
</p>
<p>Special terms for stacks: top of stack, bottom of stack.  [gqesljhpf]
</p>
<p>Knuth does not like push/pop terminology. "The brevity of words 'push' and 'pop' has its advantages, but these terms falsely imply a motion of the whole list within computer memory. Nothing is physically pushed down; items are added onto the top, as in hnaystacks or stacks of boxes".  [gfjdpalhd]
</p>
<p>Terminology for queues: front and rear.  [gidppesse]
</p>
<p>Terminology for deques: left and right.  [gdlfuuhsl]
</p>
<p>Descriptive words in English for stack/deque/queue algorithms: "up-down" for stacks, "waiting in line" for queues, and "left right" for deques.  [giihdlrko]
