<title>Focus Chips</title>
<h1>Focus Chips</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><code>Focus Chips</code> a tactile approach to time management. The
main idea is to use counting chips to represent a fixe
unit of of time (15 minutes) focusing on a task. After
that time period is up, the chip goes into a bowl. The
reasoning behind using a system like this is having
a physical representation of time. Focus is also a finite
resource, so chips can be thought of as a kind of currency.
</p>
<p>"Focus Tokens" was a considered for a name initially, but
NFTs kind of ruined the word token.
</p>

<h2>Chip Colors</h2>

<p>A color coding system is loosely enforced.
</p>
<p>Blue: research. Reading papers and textbooks and general
learning. There are 8 tokens (the goal is 2 hours of
research time a day).
</p>
<p>Yellow: creative work. Composing, creative coding, critical
listening, etc. There are 4 tokens (1 hour). Tool-building
shouldn't count here, even if it's for music.
</p>
<p>Red: "maintenence" work. Updating TODO lists, writing
tools.
</p>
<p>Determining the color of a task is highly subjective.
</p>

<h2>TODO: Time Tracking</h2>

<p>Hoping to build a logging system with this zet that will
be a daily log of the chips used. A message could like:
3 blue, 2 red, 1 yellow. This would then get parsed and
put into stats.
