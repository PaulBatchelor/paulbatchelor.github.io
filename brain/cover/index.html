<h2>Why am I suitable for the position?</h2>

<p>I know what it means to get computers to sing.
</p>
<p>I have a strong musical background. As a bassist, I've had
exposure to a lot of genres (classical, jazz, funk, rock,
gospel, folk, etc). And with that, a strong musical
intuition.
</p>
<p>Lots of practical experience building music software from
scratch. When you build these, you learn a lot about what
goes into building these systems.
</p>
<p>Very well organized. I have very good self-discipline, and
am very productive in short periods of time. I manage dozens
of personal projects that are in active development using
custom time management and documentation software.
</p>

<h2>Starting Words</h2>

<p>Dear Reader,
</p>
<p>My name is Paul Batchelor. I am a Audio Technologist,
Multimedia Composer, and Musician from Boston,
Massachussets. It is with great enthusiasm
that I submit my application and research proposal for
the INTENT PhD Scholarship. For most of my life, I have
explored the possibilities that the computer medium can
bring to the rich traditions of music.
</p>
<p>My formal education includes a Bachelor of
Music from Berklee College of Music with a focus
on Electronic Production and Design, and a Master of Arts
from Stanford University's Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics, with a focus on Music, Science,
and Technology.
</p>
<p>Being an audio technologist and composer has
taken me to interesting collaborations and projects. I
developed spectral synthesizers
on iPads, and new musical interfaces for celebrity DJ's
using the Leap Motion Controller. I helped some friends of
mine strap a Raspberry Pi to the back of a eurorack module
and watched it become the Nebualae by QuBit Electronix.
I got my hands
on a SOLI, cutting-edge research radar technology from Google,
and turned it into a musical instrument for them.
I got to work with Microsoft Research and created
award-winning musical interfaces
for musicians with ALS that utilized eye-tracking
technology. I now work closely with pranayama breathing
specialists and write generative music that helps pace
your breathing and reduce anxiety.
</p>
<p>As an audio programmer, I've built tools for
myself over the years,
and some of these have helped others. Soundpipe and Sporth
enables composers and artists to develop beautiful
interactive sounds. It most notably is included as the
low level DSP layer in AudioKit,
an iOS framework that has found itself in hundreds of music
apps, and runs on millions of devices. I also built a
fun Android App called Ethersurface, which has been very
well received over the years. For reasons I do not fully
understand, it has become a viral sensation in Russia
(something about cats).
</p>
<p>My hope is that you'll find my
distinct blend of musical and technical facilities to be a
valuable addition to your program.
I look forward learning from my future
colleagues with similar passions
and collaborating with them to create meaningful new things.
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration,
</p>
<p>Paul Batchelor
