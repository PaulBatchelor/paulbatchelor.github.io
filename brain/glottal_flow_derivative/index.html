<title>Glottal Flow Derivative</title>
<h1>Glottal Flow Derivative</h1>
<p>A technique for producing waveforms in articulatory
synthesis.
</p>
<p>Gist is: Find some mathematical way to approximate the flow
of air in the glottis. The derivative of this curve is the
waveform suitable for a time domain audio signal.
</p>
<p>Papers I am looking at that deal with this:
</p>
<p>[gasrhedw]: Hui-Ling Lu Dissertation
</p>
<p>[gfprlahl]: glottal source modelling for singing (Lu, Smith)
</p>
<p>[glhfjiwq]: Fant 1985, Four Parameter Model (aka LF Model)
</p>
<p>[greswfhd]: Fant 1995, AKA the Transformed LF Model
</p>
<p>[goqfwkij]: Lin Dissertation on Articulatory Synthesis (1991),
Lu references this paper so I grabbed it (it also has
many other things).
</p>
<p>[gpoiesop]: Strik, 1998. This paper (allegedly) approaches ways to
automatically fit an LF model, given the timing parameters.
Lu's Glottal Source Modelling casually mentions this paper
in one section.
</p>
<p>[grwuwllf]: Velhuis, 1998. Another alternative to the LF
model, Called the Rosenberg++ Model, built on the Rosenberg
Model (1971). Supposedly more efficient than LF? And
hopefully easier to compute (not sure yet).
</p>
<p>[guiupqfw]: Mushtaq and Khalid (2010). This paper outlines
a physically based glottal flow model, which is different
than the Fant analytical models. This seems to use a
mass-and-spring model, which <a href="/brain/PRC_dissertation">Perry Cook's Dissertation</a> seems to touch on all
the way in 1991. However, this one claims to be quite
efficient compared to other techniques.
