<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Research updates, as of March 19th, 2022.
</p>

<h2>The Rust Book</h2>

<p>See: <a href="/brain/rustbook">rustbook</a>.
</p>
<p>Currently in Chapter 15: Smart pointers. 5 chapters left.
</p>
<p>I can see why people like this book. It's written in
a very plain English, and structures the concepts quite
nicely.
</p>

<h2>Game Math</h2>

<p>To prep for an interview, I found and read some chapters
in a <a href="/brain/gamemath">3d math primer</a>. It's a very
well written book. The writing style is great, and the
chapters are organized in a way that you can read them
out of order. Any topics covered in other chapters are
explicitely referenced (down to the section).
</p>

<h2>Multi-threading</h2>

<p>I spent a day reading wikipedia about multithreading. Some
of what I found is condensed into a <a href="/brain/multithread">wiki page</a>. I enjoyed learning more about topic that
was otherwise an enigma to me. But my interest in
multithreaded programming and concurrency is a finite one,
and only on a "need-to-know" basis. I don't think I'll be
doing much more here.
</p>

<h2>Computer Systems: a Programmers Perspective</h2>

<p>See: <a href="/brain/computer_systems_programmers_perspective">computer_systems_programmers_perspective</a>.
</p>
<p>Somewhere in chapter 3. Honestly moving too fast for this
book. Only retaining the high-level concepts. I can
see why people say x86 can be so confusing at times.
</p>
<p>This writing book is also incredibly dry. Maybe
it's the version I have, but the math typography is
also terrible, and at times confusing.
</p>

<h2>Glottal Flow Derivative Modelling</h2>

<p>After reading some sections of <a href="/brain/PRC_dissertation">PRC_dissertation</a>,
I decided to to some digging on how people approach this.
</p>
<p>It turns out this is quite a rabbit hole. Found Huixing 
"Vicky" Lu's dissertation at CCRMA which seems to be
a follow-up to Perry Cook. Hoping to use Cook and Lu
to add glottal pulsed noise to my existing LF glottal flow
model I've been using (based on Thapen's pink trombone,
based on Lu's singing synthesises, glottal model, based on
research explored in Perry Cook's dissertation).
</p>

<h2>Time Management Techniques</h2>

<p>I made a page for my ). Hoping to start logging
that a bit better to keep track of trends over time.
