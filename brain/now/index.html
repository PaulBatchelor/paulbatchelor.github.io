<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Research updates, as of November 26th, 2022
</p>
<p>To be honest, formal research has slowed. I've been
more focused on some of my own work an projects.
</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<p>Some non-trivial changes in workflow and infrastructure
have occured in the past half-year.
</p>
<p>For starters, I've developed <a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>, a format
that allows me to easily write and tag many zettelkasten
entries at once in a collection. I often use this as a way
to transcribe handwritten notes and voice recordings.
Zetdocs with titles can be found at <a href="/brain/zetdoc_index">zetdoc_index</a>.
Titles only though. If anything looks interesting, let me
know, and I might turn it into a curated blog post.
</p>
<p>I've gotten more into doing things on pen and paper, and
have gotten into the habbit of scanning (via a portable scanner) and organizing documents. See <a href="/brain/ink">ink</a> and
<a href="/brain/notebooks">notebooks</a>.
</p>
<p>Tagging has become more automated. The
<a href="/brain/labels">labels</a> page has grown substantially, and it's
taking a fair bit longer to generate. I may have to rethink
how I'm doing things.
</p>
<p>I now own a dedicated voice recorder for my ramblings, and
have built a formal workflow around that. See <a href="/brain/voxlog">voxlog</a>.
</p>

<h2>The Art Of Computer Programming</h2>

<p>A few months ago,
I read through <a href="#">TAOCP</a> chapter 2 (volume 1) in
the laziest way possible. But I did take notes.
</p>

<h2>Singing Synthesis</h2>

<p>The Lu glottal model I keep wanting to make is on hold. This
is because I've realized that controlling these algorithms
is more important to me than the algorithms themselves.
Music won't suddenly appear because of a slightly better
sounding DSP algorithm.
</p>

<h2>Palestrina</h2>

<p>I've consumed countless hours listening to the stuff at
this point. The Sixteen has an 8 CD collection of Palestrina,
I have purchased all but two of them. Some of the tunes
are starting to sink in, and I feel ready to begin studying
some scores. More organization happening
at the <a href="/brain/palestrina">palestrina</a> page.</p>
