<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Research updates, as of Febuary 5th, 2022.
</p>

<h2>The Rust Book</h2>

<p>See: <a href="/brain/rustbook">rustbook</a>.
</p>
<p>Currently got through chapter 10 (generics, traits,
and lifetimes), a very meaty chapter.
</p>

<h2>Computer Systems: a Programmers Perspective</h2>

<p>See: <a href="/brain/computer_systems_programmers_perspective">computer_systems_programmers_perspective</a>.
</p>
<p>Just skimmed chapter 2. On hold for chapter 3 to
focus on other things.
</p>

<h2>Glottal Flow Derivative Modelling</h2>

<p>After reading some sections of <a href="/brain/PRC_dissertation">PRC_dissertation</a>,
I decided to to some digging on how people approach this.
</p>
<p>It turns out this is quite a rabbit hole. Found Huixing 
"Vicky" Lu's dissertation at CCRMA which seems to be
a follow-up to Perry Cook. Hoping to use Cook and Lu
to add glottal pulsed noise to my existing LF glottal flow
model I've been using (based on Thapen's pink trombone,
based on Lu's singing synthesises, glottal model, based on
research explored in Perry Cook's dissertation).
