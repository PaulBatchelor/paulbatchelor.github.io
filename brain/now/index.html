<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>What I've been working on here as of Jan 5, 2022.
</p>

<h2>SICP</h2>

<p>I've been moving quickly through this book, skimming
over many bits and skipping all the excersises. I am
currently somewhere in section 3. See <a href="/brain/SICP">SICP</a> for
more info.
</p>

<h2>Dabblings with Rust</h2>

<p>I have also begun my journey with the <a href="/brain/rust">rust</a>programming language. I am working my way through the
<a href="/brain/rustbook">Rust Book</a>.
</p>

<h2>Building up a Glossary</h2>

<p>Also trying to get into the habit of making a
<a href="/brain/glossary">glossary</a>. It's just a group I tag messages in at the moment, but my hope
is to add more structure to it.
