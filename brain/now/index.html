<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Research updates, as of June 28th, 2022
</p>

<h2>The Art Of Computer Programming</h2>

<p>Reading through the art of computer programming, volume 1.
Just reading, not motivated enough to work on problem sets.
My transcribed notes can be found at @(ref "TAOCP")!@.
</p>

<h2>Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire (Gibbon)</h2>

<p>I never often get a context to bring this up, but
I just finished this yesterday. 6 months of reading 15
minutes a day.
</p>

<h2>Singing Synthesis</h2>

<p>Vocal tract filter (digital waveguide models based on Cook)
and glottal source algorithms (based on work by Lu) are in
development. The glottal source algorithm will probably
be finished first, since it's what I've been reading about
more recently.
</p>
<p>Starting to think about things like interface. How to
best use the physical interface I have (Monome Grid, Arc),
to "sculpt" phoneme states.
