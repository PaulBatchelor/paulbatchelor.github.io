<h1>Now Page</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Research updates, as of April 13th, 2022
</p>

<h2>The Algorithm Design Manual</h2>

<p>See: <a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>.
</p>
<p>This is the next book in the <a href="/brain/TYCS">TYCS</a> series.
I'm currently somewhere in Chapter 3.
</p>

<h2>Computer Systems: a Programmers Perspective</h2>

<p>See: <a href="/brain/computer_systems_programmers_perspective">computer_systems_programmers_perspective</a>.
</p>
<p>Completed the required reading for <a href="/brain/TYCS">TYCS</a>(chapters 1-6). Moving onto other things.
</p>

<h2>Singing Synthesis</h2>

<p>More studying of the tube-resonance model described
in GnuSpeech. It turns out the topology matches
exactly that of the one described in Perry Cook's
waveguide patent (expired in 2013).
</p>
<p>I've amassed quited a few resources on articulatory
synthesis at this point, it might be worth making
a page dedicated to those.
    * Palestrina
I've decided to begin a deep dive into the works of
<a href="/brain/palestrina">Palestrina</a>. Palestrina is
interesting to me because of the highly contrapuntal
nature of the work, and the fact that it is related
to the voice.
</p>
<p>I've collected scores for all the masses from IMSLP,
and am slowly purchasing the 8-volume CD collection of
Palestrina performed by The Sixteen (currently have 2).
