<h1>Now Page</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Research updates, as of April 5th, 2022
</p>

<h2>The Rust Book</h2>

<p>See: <a href="/brain/rustbook">rustbook</a>.
</p>
<p>Finished! Thinking about what to do after. Most likely,
I'll begin working on porting some DSP algorithms from
sndkit into a Rust library, as well as the
underlying graforge patching system that is used to tie
algorithms together.
</p>

<h2>Computer Systems: a Programmers Perspective</h2>

<p>See: <a href="/brain/computer_systems_programmers_perspective">computer_systems_programmers_perspective</a>.
</p>
<p>I have just arrived on chapter 5. After chapter 6, I'll
be done with what I want to read in this book and
moving on to the next book in <a href="/brain/TYCS">TYCS</a>.
</p>

<h2>Singing Synthesis</h2>

<p>Currently studying the DSP model in GnuSpeech. Hoping
to learn how fricatives and plosives are handled. Not
much reading has been done.
</p>
<p>I've amassed quited a few resources on articulatory
synthesis at this point, it might be worth making
a page dedicated to those.
</p>

<h2>Palestrina</h2>

<p>I've decided to begin a deep dive into the works of
<a href="/brain/palestrina">Palestrina</a>. Palestrina is
interesting to me because of the highly contrapuntal
nature of the work, and the fact that it is related
to the voice.
</p>
<p>I've collected scores for all the masses from IMSLP,
and am slowly purchasing the 8-volume CD collection of
Palestrina performed by The Sixteen (currently have 2).
