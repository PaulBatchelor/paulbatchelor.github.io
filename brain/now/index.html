<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Research updates, as of June 14th, 2022
</p>

<h2>The Algorithm Design Manual</h2>

<p>See: <a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>.
</p>
<p>This is the next book in the <a href="/brain/TYCS">TYCS</a> series.
</p>
<p>As of today, I have completed reading the first half.
Still need to type up my notes.
</p>

<h2>Singing Synthesis</h2>

<p>Starting preliminary work on a new singing synthesizer
model. Working on implementation of algorithm. Also
thinking about interface for building up voices.
</p>

<h2>Palestrina</h2>

<p>I now have 4 Palestrina CDs. Listening to them pretty
regularly. Palestrina is very "decorrelated", so it's
hard for it to get stuck in your head.
</p>
<p>Hoping to at some point sequence a few Palestrina passages,
and maybe translate some scores in a more computer-friendly
format than PDFs? (Lilypond, perhaps?). Performances will
be sequenced using my gesture systems. Maybe on my singing
synthesizers, and perhaps my singing synthesizers (though
they don't sound good when used in an ensemble yet).
