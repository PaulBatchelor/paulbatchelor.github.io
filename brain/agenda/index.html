<h2>[gifshhlss] create re-usable code for loading tile maps from text files. (5 points)</h2>


<h2>[gjulfhihr] create initial notation system for gesture paths (4 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-10-12 05:56:56:</b></p>
<p>gesture "sigils" (working name for components representing the value itself) are coming along. sketched some prototype symbols. It would be nice to have these coded up into an image, similar to what happened with L-glyphs.
</p>
<p><b>2022-10-11 07:01:29:</b></p>
<p>things that need to be thought about include the main value (a 7x7 pixel symbol that's square kufic inspired), and the behavior (it's a 'hat' or overbar)
</p>
<p><b>2022-10-11 07:00:02:</b></p>
<p>initial sketches for L-glyphs, which will turn into a number system for representing duration. That character set has yet to be established.
</p>
<p><b>2022-10-05 06:37:14:</b></p>
<p>Ironing out the details for what this will look like. The concept at the moment is to get a notation system working with btprnt and janet. This would allow scores to be embedded in wiki pages. Helpful for my emerging 'gestlings' etudes.

<h2>[gifepifeu] figure out how PRC is doing vocal tract analysis (2 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-10-05 06:41:38:</b></p>
<p>"LPC provides a set of filter coefficients, and the vocal tract area functions can be obtained from the coefficients using recursive procedures such as the Levinson, Schur, and Durbin recursions".
</p>
<p><b>2022-10-05 06:40:06:</b></p>
<p>see: 1.7.1 Identifying the Vocal Tract Filter. Page 37.
</p>
<p><b>2022-06-29 10:57:50:</b></p>
<p>In the case of Lu, the tract filter was only designed for finding solutions to open vowel states. Things like velum were not included.
</p>
<p><b>2022-06-29 10:56:34:</b></p>
<p>It's some kind of LPC, there's a specific name for it. I believe Lu also talks about it. PRC uses the term "section peeling". It's a recursive strategy. There are papers it references.
</p>
<p><b>2022-05-12 09:50:57:</b></p>
<p>I found the section and read about it a while ago. There was some recursive approach involving LPC. I think. I'd like to find it again and try to better grok it.
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-15 09:42:21:</b></p>
<p>from what I've read, I think it has something to do with LPC, which he talks about a little before. Will need to look at it again.

<p><b>2022-04-30 05:57:11:</b></p>
<p>many textbooks, like (<a href="#">TAOCP</a>), have answers. which is interesting. This tells me the nature of a problem set doesn't necessarily mean to work until you find the correct answer, or even an answer. Perhaps thinking about it long enough is a okay if that's all you can muster.
</p>
<p><b>2022-04-30 05:55:38:</b></p>
<p>got that urge to put some time into problem sets. I feel like I'm missing some intuition with some of these later chapters in (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>).

<p>almost there. turns out some of these had missing pages, and some don't seem to be from the missarum (Regina Caeli/Coeli had to be downloaded again from Liber 12). Not done checking everything.
