<h2>[gkdardiiw] review "thoughts on gestured sound" (3 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-06-30 10:54:10:</b></p>
<p>editing. now going back and adding tags for each chunk.
</p>
<p><b>2022-06-29 10:53:23:</b></p>
<p>notes and transcriptions taken down in staging/c.txt. will begin to revise and turn it into a zetdoc
</p>
</p>

<h2>[gifepifeu] figure out how PRC is doing vocal tract analysis (2 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-06-29 10:57:50:</b></p>
<p>In the case of Lu, the tract filter was only designed for finding solutions to open vowel states. Things like velum were not included.
</p>
<p><b>2022-06-29 10:56:34:</b></p>
<p>It's some kind of LPC, there's a specific name for it. I believe Lu also talks about it. PRC uses the term "section peeling". It's a recursive strategy. There are papers it references.
</p>
<p><b>2022-05-12 09:50:57:</b></p>
<p>I found the section and read about it a while ago. There was some recursive approach involving LPC. I think. I'd like to find it again and try to better grok it.
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-15 09:42:21:</b></p>
<p>from what I've read, I think it has something to do with LPC, which he talks about a little before. Will need to look at it again.
</p>

<h2>[goefwklsf] create outline of PRC thesis (2 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-05-12 09:48:00:</b></p>
<p>I think the scope of this is just to transcribe the table of contents. I can use (<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>) system to take notes.
</p>

<p><b>2022-04-14 15:50:47:</b></p>
<p>one of those low-effort tasks
</p>

<h2>[gwoehifsr] brainstorm: strategy for tackling problem sets? (0 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-04-30 05:57:11:</b></p>
<p>many textbooks, like (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>), have answers. which is interesting. This tells me the nature of a problem set doesn't necessarily mean to work until you find the correct answer, or even an answer. Perhaps thinking about it long enough is a okay if that's all you can muster.
</p>
<p><b>2022-04-30 05:55:38:</b></p>
<p>got that urge to put some time into problem sets. I feel like I'm missing some intuition with some of these later chapters in (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>).

<h2>[gadfjoaer] get simple example working for musixtex (0 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-06-18 07:38:06:</b></p>
<p>it would be nice to get this working on KerTeX eventually.
</p>
