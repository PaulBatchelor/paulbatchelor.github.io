<h2>[gwoehifsr] brainstorm: strategy for tackling problem sets? (0 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-04-30 05:57:11:</b></p>
<p>many textbooks, like (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>), have answers. which is interesting. This tells me the nature of a problem set doesn't necessarily mean to work until you find the correct answer, or even an answer. Perhaps thinking about it long enough is a okay if that's all you can muster.
</p>
<p><b>2022-04-30 05:55:38:</b></p>
<p>got that urge to put some time into problem sets. I feel like I'm missing some intuition with some of these later chapters in (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>).

<p>producing a tree map for the namespaces. eventually this will be used to generate static HTML pages
</p>
<p><b>2023-10-23 06:34:31:</b></p>
<p>I think the data structure for trees technically works. however, I'm using hashmaps, which is a bit clunky because the end nodes are all empty keys and that is very verbose in the JSON output. Attempting to move to more of an s-expression list structure.
</p>
<p><b>2023-10-21 16:07:52:</b></p>
<p>going to try and get a tree structure working for the visualization. this should work for digraphs if nodes are allowed to repeat. I don't think there will be any loops because DAGs are acyclic.
</p>
<p><b>2023-10-20 13:06:22:</b></p>
<p>taking a very "semantic web" approach to this: generate all the structured data needed, then have the HTML step be just about rendering
</p>
<p><b>2023-10-20 13:05:24:</b></p>
<p>hoping to begin thinking about some basic page displays of namespaced graphs
</p>
<p><b>2023-10-14 13:08:16:</b></p>
<p>working on producing SQLite statements from dagzet command code.
</p>
<p><b>2023-10-13 10:35:59:</b></p>
<p>adding cycle checks via topological sorting
