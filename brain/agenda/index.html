<h2>[gsisjsqul] make a process that automatically imports and labels voxlogs, as well as creates a zetdo task to review them (3 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-06-24 20:59:14:</b></p>
<p>cautiously optmistic that this works. importing the backlog one by one
</p>
<p><b>2022-06-22 10:52:25:</b></p>
<p>I've created a placeholder script called u/voxlog_import
</p>
<p><b>2022-06-22 10:47:39:</b></p>
<p>the inputs are a list of mp3 files that have been named. these would need to be added to the voxlog sqlar file (perhaps via u/append), then a zetdo task needs to be made that references this file somehow. I think zetdoc may have procedurally generated a task before, so I can maybe look at that.
</p>
<p><b>2022-06-04 18:58:56:</b></p>
<p>as of today, we officially have a backlog. it would be best to get on this.

<h2>[gdfkhpjuh] review glottal pulsed noise, as presented in PRC and Lu (3 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-06-19 16:24:20:</b></p>
<p>with (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>) out of the way, this might be what I read up on in my morning slot
</p>
</p>

<h2>[gifepifeu] figure out how PRC is doing vocal tract analysis (2 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-05-12 09:50:57:</b></p>
<p>I found the section and read about it a while ago. There was some recursive approach involving LPC. I think. I'd like to find it again and try to better grok it.
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-15 09:42:21:</b></p>
<p>from what I've read, I think it has something to do with LPC, which he talks about a little before. Will need to look at it again.
</p>
</p>

<h2>[goefwklsf] create outline of PRC thesis (2 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-05-12 09:48:00:</b></p>
<p>I think the scope of this is just to transcribe the table of contents. I can use (<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>) system to take notes.
</p>
</p>

<h2>[giqijuilq] hardcastle reading list (1 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-01-10 17:24:45:</b></p>
<p>articulatory-acoustic-phonetic relations and modelling, reigions, and modes
</p>
<p><b>2022-01-10 17:23:55:</b></p>
<p>articulatory-acoustic relationships in fricative consonants
</p>
<p><b>2022-01-10 17:23:35:</b></p>
<p>articulatory synthesis
</p>
</p>

<h2>[goarkrwri] create outline of Degottex thesis (0 points)</h2>


<h2>[gkdffhkko] create outline of mullen thesis (0 points)</h2>


<h2>[gewpfjpjd] add mathematics for computer science (mcs.pdf) to crate (0 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-04-14 15:50:47:</b></p>
<p>one of those low-effort tasks
</p>
</p>

<h2>[gwoehifsr] brainstorm: strategy for tackling problem sets? (0 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-04-30 05:57:11:</b></p>
<p>many textbooks, like (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>), have answers. which is interesting. This tells me the nature of a problem set doesn't necessarily mean to work until you find the correct answer, or even an answer. Perhaps thinking about it long enough is a okay if that's all you can muster.
</p>
<p><b>2022-04-30 05:55:38:</b></p>
<p>got that urge to put some time into problem sets. I feel like I'm missing some intuition with some of these later chapters in (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>).
</p>
</p>

<h2>[gkdardiiw] review "thoughts on gestured sound" (0 points)</h2>


<h2>[gadfjoaer] get simple example working for musixtex (0 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-06-18 07:38:06:</b></p>
<p>it would be nice to get this working on KerTeX eventually.
