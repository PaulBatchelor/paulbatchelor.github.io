<h2>[gwoehifsr] brainstorm: strategy for tackling problem sets? (0 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-04-30 05:57:11:</b></p>
<p>many textbooks, like (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>), have answers. which is interesting. This tells me the nature of a problem set doesn't necessarily mean to work until you find the correct answer, or even an answer. Perhaps thinking about it long enough is a okay if that's all you can muster.

<p>got that urge to put some time into problem sets. I feel like I'm missing some intuition with some of these later chapters in (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>).
