<h2>[gdfofqkri] read first half of "The Algorithm Design Manual" (4 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-05-11 09:33:38:</b></p>
<p>as of writing, I have just started chapter 11 (NP completeness). Due to eink malfunctions, I've transitioned my notetaking setup to be handwritten, then transferred to (<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>) in a secondary stage. As a result, things showing up on the (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>) page will take a little longer, and will be less, but maybe a bit more meaningful?
</p>
<p><b>2022-04-24 14:36:45:</b></p>
<p>as of right now, I have just finished reading chapter 7 and am onto chapter 8. I definitely want to go back and read this. Problem sets would be great, but I want the general knowledge first, at which point I'll jump into problem sets.

<h2>[gsoqolaqe] study gnuspeech TRM (3 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-05-12 09:52:43:</b></p>
<p>it turns out that the topology of the TRM is identical to the patent that PRC filed on the vocal tract with waveguides. It expired in 2013, so it's possible gnuspeech may have been violating a patent when they were working on that in the late 90s and early 00s.
</p>
<p><b>2022-05-11 09:29:29:</b></p>
<p>added some boilerplate sndkit code to my little playground code. I'm using the C API directly rather than LIL, as that's just an extra step for what is basically the same thing. Up to this point, I haven't found many opportunities to use the C API for sndkit directly, so this is kinda cool.
</p>
<p><b>2022-05-10 09:33:59:</b></p>
<p>I'm about ready to test my extracted bit
</p>
<p><b>2022-04-14 15:45:33:</b></p>
<p>this can be done after I've extracted the initial tract to ANSI C.
</p>
<p><b>2022-04-14 15:45:16:</b></p>
<p>in progress. the approach right now is to extract bits of the TRM one component at a time.
</p>

<h2>[gifepifeu] figure out how PRC is doing vocal tract analysis (2 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-05-12 09:50:57:</b></p>
<p>I found the section and read about it a while ago. There was some recursive approach involving LPC. I think. I'd like to find it again and try to better grok it.
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-15 09:42:21:</b></p>
<p>from what I've read, I think it has something to do with LPC, which he talks about a little before. Will need to look at it again.
</p>

<h2>[goefwklsf] create outline of PRC thesis (2 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-05-12 09:48:00:</b></p>
<p>I think the scope of this is just to transcribe the table of contents. I can use (<a href="/brain/zetdoc">zetdoc</a>) system to take notes.
</p>

<h2>[giqijuilq] hardcastle reading list (1 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-01-10 17:24:45:</b></p>

<h2>[gewpfjpjd] add mathematics for computer science (mcs.pdf) to crate (0 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-04-14 15:50:47:</b></p>
<p>one of those low-effort tasks
</p>

<h2>[gwoehifsr] brainstorm: strategy for tackling problem sets? (0 points)</h2>

<p><b>2022-04-30 05:57:11:</b></p>
<p>many textbooks, like (<a href="/brain/TAOCP">TAOCP</a>), have answers. which is interesting. This tells me the nature of a problem set doesn't necessarily mean to work until you find the correct answer, or even an answer. Perhaps thinking about it long enough is a okay if that's all you can muster.
</p>
<p><b>2022-04-30 05:55:38:</b></p>
<p>got that urge to put some time into problem sets. I feel like I'm missing some intuition with some of these later chapters in (<a href="/brain/TADM">TADM</a>).
