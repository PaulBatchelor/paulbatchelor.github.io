<p>I think if were to do this again, I'd go bottoms-up and read only the initial chapters, following the links interactively to build a mental model of the overall kubernetes system.

<p>Writing styles have quite a range. It is clear that this is multi-author. Some people have an RFC document style tone. Some copy-pasted paragraphs and slightly changed the wording. I swear there was even a section that was written by someone who really liked colorful metaphors (it wasn't great). There was definitely a range of quality. I think the best writing emerged in some of the opening chapters which were more about overview. Clear and concise. As things got more detailed and specific, the writing tended to descend into word salad.

<p>'Overengineered' is almost the word I'd use to describe Kubernetes. It has a lot of software engineering thrown at it. A lot of interfaces and structures seem to come from solving very specific problems that have occured into the real world. Many times, it seems like the developers coded up an initial solutionfor their particular setup, then worked backwards to build something that could be merged upstream. It comes across as inelegant to me, but I guess it works for them.
</p>

<p>Kubernetes as a system is made up of many abstractions. It thinks about computing at a very large scale. So large, the concepts they invent stop feeling like computers anymore. There are a lot of buzzwords, and if you don't understand all the buzzwords for a given context, comprehension will be strained.
</p>

<p>This was not meant to be a document read cover-to-cover, even though I did it that way, though it was a decent way to absorb the gist of the system. This book is very link driven, and probably would have been better appreciated as an interactive document.
</p>
<p><b>2023-12-02 08:58:15:</b></p>
<p>Finally finished with this 'book'. What a slog. Long and dry. I didn't take any notes, so I suppose I should say a few words about the experience while it is still fresh.
