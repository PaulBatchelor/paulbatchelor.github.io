<h2>1. Some Initial Words and Prethoughts</h2>

<p>In the (proposed) gesture notation system, diacritics,
or ornamentation above the glyph, will serve
to denote the <code>behavior</code> of the gesture at that point
in time.
</p>
<p>Gesture algorithms such as the
<code>Gesture Signal Generator</code> can be thought of as a
specialized kind of breakpoint line generator, similar
to automation curves found in a DAW. Both take in
points spaced out by durations, and then
they fill out those areas in between
those points to produce a continuous line segment.
This "filling out" method is often discussed using terms
like "interpolation" or "interpolation method". In this
context, the term "behavior" is used to describe the way
one point transitions to the next point.
</p>
<p>The term "behavior" was chosen because it felt more
musically relevant. The way a melody travels from one
note to the next indeed can say a lot about the underlying
mood or behavior of the particular phrase, oftentimes more
so than the notes (pitches) themselves.
</p>
<p>The proposed gesture notation specification reserves the
entire overbar region for diacritical marks, as well as the
left and right "flaps" underneath it.
</p>
<p>The overbar is long and skinny. It has a thickness of
4 pixels, and length of 24 pixels.
</p>
<p>The overbar can be broken in to 4x4 pixel squares,
similar to <a href="/gestlings/curated_lglyphs">L-glyphs</a>. There
are 6 of these squares instead of just 4, which can lead
to subdivisions and groupings of 6, 3, and 2. The flaps
are each 2 4x4 squares, yielding an additional 4 squares.
</p>
<p>At the moment, there are 4 actively used behaviors: step,
linear, exponential, and gliss. Gliss has at least 3 modes:
small medium large. Exponential has those modes as well,
with an additional mode inidicating positive or negative
slope.
</p>
<p>4x4 squares can be arranged in two ways on the overbar.
One way is to lay 6 of them out so that bar is evenly
divided into four sections. The second way is to treat
the ends of the bar as margins 2 pixels wide, and to
divide the remaining space into 5 4x4 squares. The latter
gives some things that are aesthetically pleasing: a center
square, and some padding.
</p>

<h2>2. The Proto-Diacritics</h2>

<p>Here are some imagined diacritical marks. Perhaps some
of these will end up being used to notate behavior in
a gesture:

<h2>3. The Code</h2>

<p>The image above was procedurally generated using Janet code
to produce an inline PNG image.
</p>
<p>It's probably not worth the time to break this down into
smaller codeblocks and talk about. I will leave the mess as
is.
</p>
<p>The gist of this program is similar to those that have
preceded it like <a href="/gestlings/curated_lglyphs">curated_lglyphs</a> and
<a href="/gestlings/protosigils">protosigils</a>: a handful of pre-made tiles
are loaded up into memory via <a href="/gestlings/loadtiles">loadtiles</a>, and
then these are arranged to produce the diacritics you see
on the page. Some abstractions have been made to make it
easier to explore new combinations.

<h2>4. Final words and post-thoughts</h2>

<p>This is my third, and most likely final prototyping design,
as behavior diacritics are the last point of consideration
for my overall system.
</p>
<p>One of the subtle things I discovered while making things
was the importance of alignment between the overbar and
the "flaps". In the course of making these, I made slight
adjustments to some of the core tilesets to make them line
up better.
</p>
<p>With all the main components made, I've begun to string
things all together to see what it looks like. For the
most part, I am pleased, though I find myself thinking
about line thickness. For the most part, black "lines"
are 2 pixels thick, but occasionally you'll find radicals
that are 1 pixel thick. It can sometimes look a little
uneven.
</p>
<p>The radicals chosen for the "flaps" need to be chosen
carefully. There's an aesthetic I'm going for that I can't
fully articulate, but some of these combinations look
better than others. Placement and contrext matters.
