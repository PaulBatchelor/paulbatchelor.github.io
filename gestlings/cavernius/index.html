<p>Cavernius was a massive asteroid, with a hollow core that
formed a giant cave.</p>
<p>Cavernius was lonely. It was too quiet for them, and they
longed for company.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the <a href="/gestlings/universe">Universe</a> during this age was
abundant with <a href="/gestlings/inspiration">Inspiration</a>.</p>
<p>Deep inside the Cave of Cavernius, Inspiration gathered. A
warmth began to form, which turned into a great heat.</p>
<p>A transformation was about to occur.</p>
<p>Fortified with Inspiration, The Caves of Cavernius filled
with a molten core. Cavernius was so overwhelmed by the
change, they wept tears of joy. And those tears formed
the <a href="/gestlings/springs">Great Springs</a>, which is where
life began to grow.</p>
<p>It was at this point that Cavernius
became <a href="/gestlings/cauldronia">Cauldronia</a>.</p>
