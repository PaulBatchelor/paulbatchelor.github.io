<p><b>2023-08-01 17:15:07</b>: tilemap proof of concept
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-31 16:19:06</b>: might want to anticipate having a tile being drawn on more than once. having a masking bit might be a good idea. These can be visualized with varibright, and maybe a toggle to go between mask mode and color mode
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-29 14:14:13</b>: create tile editor for grid zero
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-29 13:27:01</b>: I need to make map tiles. I could just write these up in a text editor like I've done in the past and that'd be a quick and dirty way to do it, but I'm going to induldge a little bit and build a 16x16 tile editor that works with my new grid zero.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-29 12:23:44</b>: janet JSON bindings have been added to weewiki, have not tested it, but I assume it will work.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-29 12:17:17</b>: there's a slow pure-janet implementation of a JSON parser that I could use in a pinch if I didn't want to touch weewiki. But, you know, if weewiki has btprnt bindings, it should have JSON stuff too.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-29 12:16:34</b>: oh, looks like I already added the JSON utility to gestlings for lua
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-29 12:11:00</b>: I do not have JSON stuff included with weewiki janet. I don't have a JSON encoder for lua either here. I'm just gonna have to do both. I'm choosing JSON over msgpack here because I think it's a little bit more straight forward, and the data is more suitable for JSON.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-29 12:06:43</b>: part of this involves getting the sound/video engine (cantor/mnolth) to talk to the wiki engine (weewiki). I'm going to look into creating an intermediate format that cantor can write to, that weewiki (janet) can parse. I forget if I'm including JSON stuff with weewiki or not.

<h3>create tile editor for grid zero</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-01 12:12:29</b>: I'm tempted to build a tile layout editor as well, since the current alternative is to use a text editor. I'm afraid it might be too much tool mind though. Instead, I'm going to work on exporting a tilemap and using it to make a test map.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-29 22:29:27</b>: I'm using the varibright mappings to generate an outline for the 8x8 shape. super helpful.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-29 22:12:32</b>: 16x16 is too much. going to do 8x8 instead. it would be nice to have the option to use all 4 quadrants at once to test combos to make up 16x16 tiles. but there isn't time.
