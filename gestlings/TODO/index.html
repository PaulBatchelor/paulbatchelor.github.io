<p><b>2023-08-11 15:40:25</b>: it's looking like the most foolproof way to render eyes on faces is to everything in one SDF, and use the subtract operator to remove stuff underneath the eyes. I've renamed what I'm calling "registers" to "uniforms" in sdf2d. I'll be adding actual registers to make it easier for shader programs to store masking data for eyes and mouths.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-11 13:05:40</b>: I keep laughing at this bug-eyed gestling pressed up against the glass. worth the time.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:48:10</b>: depending on how far along the drawing pipeline is, include animation? I'm mainly thinking about ways eyes with an iris can look around at things. perhaps this includes eyes getting larger/smaller/thinner/wider too

<p><b>2023-09-01 14:42:17</b>: deciding that the the trailer was a good first start for setting up a drawing gestling avatars, and that this task is the second draft that will involve pulling stuff out and making meaningful abstractions
</p>

</p>
<p>gestlings don't really have 'bodies', in the same way kirby and jigglypuff don't really have bodies. it's really more of a floating head in my mind. no time for limbs. but body is a little less ambiguous than something like 'head'

<h3>eyes, body, mouth, and sound</h3>

<a id="ea0bec5a"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#ea0bec5a">#ea0bec5a</a>.
</p>
<p>a placeholder sound should be visualized with a gestling. eyes, mouth, and body should be animated. states should be parsed from a descript file.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-13 11:44:23</b>: thinking about making a teaser trailer for gestlings. 4 gestlings singing the gestleton theme song, with a little creepy ritualistic mantra chant thing at the end. I think I'm going to repurpose this task to be about getting one singer working. After that, I'll make another task related to the trailer.

<h3>establish initial "junior" phrases</h3>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-09-22 08:55:08</b>: adding the singing notes and symbols
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-18 14:08:45</b>: I think I've worked out enough of the pipeline where I can create some symbols for each word I have in the vocab so far. Then, I'll have to build out the bitrune instance that actually compiles and re-runs phrases.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-17 09:33:19</b>: still working on live coding interface. trying to pull out the phrase bit.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-16 19:38:40</b>: taking a step back, and getting a live coding interface working for junior words
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-11 09:45:56</b>: few things left to do before I feel this is done. One is to be able to save/load words and prosody components. I also want to add another prosody curve for intensity. In this case, junior will whisper at the lowest intensity. Higher intensities... vibrato with larger depth and faster rate?
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-11 07:37:09</b>: with the scaling in place, my goal now is to try to simulate how the timings would work when rendering video
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-09 14:14:53</b>: phrases need to encompass the space of one long monoramp. right now, they are tuned to a regular conductor ramp. will tweak the existing prototype and see how well it works.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-08 15:50:02</b>: getting some initial vocabulary generated. now figuring out prosody curves.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-07 12:54:51</b>: tooling needs to be built out for this

</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-09-21 13:01:57</b>: I feel like most of the components are working now. I am now able to render a video with placeholder lines, so this feels established.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-21 09:54:46</b>: okay we got some initial junior sounds. now to see how it lines up with the video.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-21 08:42:50</b>: going to start adding phrases to the junior dialogue script.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-20 19:25:55</b>: creating an initial junior physiology lua module. pretty sure this is the last major component before I can start bringing things into the trailer.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-20 14:59:08</b>: consolidating most of the junior data that exists into a single bundle. I still need to port the sound itself, as well as make the phrase generators more portable.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-20 13:30:30</b>: I'm creating a character bundle. there are so many files that go into 'junior', and it doesn't make sense for the trailer to have to keep track of all of it.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-20 09:26:19</b>: now that there's a decent set of test phrases, I now need to make steps towards getting those phrases into the trailer and script.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-19 19:47:17</b>: a reference card has been generated for junior. I should be able to key in some phrases now. the evalator needs to be hooked in now.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-19 10:03:15</b>: I need to generate a reference card. I'm never going to remember the symbols and keyshapes otherwise.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-18 09:34:09</b>: reworking the junior words to use symbols. still counting this as part of the overall phrase pipeline creation.
