<h3>create outline of maps of cauldronia</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-07-27 13:36:05</b>: what's emerged from this brainstorming exercise are various places in Cauldronia, which could be thought of as "levels". I think it would be a good idea to build some boilerplate pages for these with links to the next/prev levels.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-27 13:34:00</b>: I've outlined a map of cauldronia in terms of linear storyline. You start a Gestleton at the top of the Gestletree, and eventually end up at the bottom of the ocean, where you enter the Hall of Was and meet the Gardner. This is a pretty good birds-eye view of the major areas, but no detail.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-23 22:28:44</b>: I think I have a "logo" for the gestlings. or, at least a good symbol for Cauldronia, the celestial body where the Gestlings reside. Doodled some things.

<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-07-27 13:51:05</b>: not sure how much more I can do at this point in time with dialogue. I feel like I need to outline the levels first before thinking about NPCs and dialogue. Will leave this open for a little while longer, then close.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-22 22:16:33</b>: I've been thinking about an introduction. will try to draft something out.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-22 22:15:45</b>: the initial protogestling works with a 200x320 canvas, which I may bump to 240x320. That leaves 30 characters per line using the 8px fixed width font. if there are margins, that's probably 28 actually. There are 4 lines currently. That comprises one message box, of which there can be several.

<h2>create imagemap proof of concept</h2>

<a id="f3c4df2e"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#f3c4df2e">#f3c4df2e</a>.
</p>
<p>I'm thinking about using oldschool HTML imagemaps as a way to make a point-and-click mechanic for the various levels in Gestlings. I'll need to see how well that works though, so this task aims to gauge the feasability of this.
