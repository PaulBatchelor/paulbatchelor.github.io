<p><b>2023-09-02 18:56:00</b>: oh, and backspace would be very funny.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-02 18:55:47</b>: all the basics are here I think. but I'd like to add more font choices, and change the size as well.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-02 10:46:59</b>: for instance, the trailer is just going to be a message box with voice, and maybe soundtrack. the messgage box will be zoomed with padding to make it fit a standard resolution.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-02 10:46:03</b>: might as well mention that I'm also thinking about making a second trailer, and will be making some decisions for that now.
</p>
<p><b>2023-09-01 14:43:36</b>: the initial implementation here is going to be coded up in the scratch folder.

<h2>work out initial eye designs</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-11 15:40:25</b>: it's looking like the most foolproof way to render eyes on faces is to everything in one SDF, and use the subtract operator to remove stuff underneath the eyes. I've renamed what I'm calling "registers" to "uniforms" in sdf2d. I'll be adding actual registers to make it easier for shader programs to store masking data for eyes and mouths.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-11 13:05:40</b>: I keep laughing at this bug-eyed gestling pressed up against the glass. worth the time.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:48:10</b>: depending on how far along the drawing pipeline is, include animation? I'm mainly thinking about ways eyes with an iris can look around at things. perhaps this includes eyes getting larger/smaller/thinner/wider too

<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-09-01 14:42:17</b>: deciding that the the trailer was a good first start for setting up a drawing gestling avatars, and that this task is the second draft that will involve pulling stuff out and making meaningful abstractions
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:55:01</b>: eyes, body, mouth, and sound

</p>
<p>gestlings don't really have 'bodies', in the same way kirby and jigglypuff don't really have bodies. it's really more of a floating head in my mind. no time for limbs. but body is a little less ambiguous than something like 'head'

<h3>eyes, body, mouth, and sound</h3>

<a id="ea0bec5a"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#ea0bec5a">#ea0bec5a</a>.
</p>
<p>a placeholder sound should be visualized with a gestling. eyes, mouth, and body should be animated. states should be parsed from a descript file.

<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-13 11:44:23</b>: thinking about making a teaser trailer for gestlings. 4 gestlings singing the gestleton theme song, with a little creepy ritualistic mantra chant thing at the end. I think I'm going to repurpose this task to be about getting one singer working. After that, I'll make another task related to the trailer.
