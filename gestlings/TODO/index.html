<h3>mouth animation proof of concept</h3>

<a id="e37a2977"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#e37a2977">#e37a2977</a>.
</p>
<p>results: an animation (no sound) of a mouth, interpolating between at least 2 shapes.

<p><b>2023-08-08 12:57:06</b>: I'm going to make a wiki page for this program.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-08 12:45:06</b>: it works!
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:40:30</b>: this will nicely set the stage for when I start making other Gestling parts, as the animation done here will be very similar to what is required for those. The mouth animation will evolve to be controlled via gesture instead of through lua code.

<h3>mouth animation with gesture proof of concept</h3>

<a id="dbe9ea14"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#dbe9ea14">#dbe9ea14</a>.
</p>
<p>have an animation that is controlled using gesture. there should be sound for this too.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:44:44</b>: a thought on facial expressions: happy/sad faces (curve up/down) can be weights applied to an existing shape. interpolating between the weights smoothly goes between them.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:43:48</b>: scoping gesture control to only be functional, mapping sounds to mouth shapes. anything that's related to facial expressions should be relegated somewhere else.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:43:07</b>: currently thinking there are at least two gestures for mouth control: one that signals open/close, and another for shape.

<h3>create mouth shape with lua code</h3>

<a id="e2f9df7f"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#e2f9df7f">#e2f9df7f</a>.
</p>
<p>easier said than done, because there is no tooling yet to get this stuff working in Lua.

<p><b>2023-08-06 15:12:00</b>: since my mouthtests program is going to eventually become the basis for bpsdf, I'm going to put in the time break this up into sections as a literate document. It'll give me a chance to review the code and treat bpsdf as a second draft.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-06 00:36:55</b>: implement bpsdf
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-06 00:36:49</b>: got everything up to a lua script outlining how it could work if it was fully implemented. What's missing is a thing called "bpsdf", this is the btprnt function that draws an SDF program onto a btprnt region.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-05 23:33:11</b>: the mouthtest program for the first mouth has been reworked to use the program. now I just need to rework the code for the 15 other ones in the demo. doable, but tedious.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-05 17:35:45</b>: demo in sdf2d reworked to use registers, and it's the mouth shape. if I can add a funciton for mno_buffer that can insert a floating point value into a buffer, I think I have all the prerequisites ready.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-05 17:04:11</b>: still going to need a register interface. working on that now.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-05 16:48:39</b>: going to rework the mouthtests program yesterday to use the bytecode version of the program instead of the raw calls. that way, it'll be in a better position to port to lua
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-05 16:45:20</b>: initial bytecode generator done. If I generate a pre-generated lookup table for the bytecode symbols, and invent a convenient way to convert lua floats to binary float32 values, I should be in a good place for the the bytecode.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-05 15:09:49</b>: I'm also going to need registers, and the ability for lua to set those registers.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-05 15:09:18</b>: the workflow proposed is this: lua generates bytecode, bytecode is written to sndkit buffer, buffer is parsed by sdfvm as a read-only program.

<p><b>2023-08-04 22:48:10</b>: depending on how far along the drawing pipeline is, include animation? I'm mainly thinking about ways eyes with an iris can look around at things. perhaps this includes eyes getting larger/smaller/thinner/wider too

<a id="e3517d0d"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#e3517d0d">#e3517d0d</a>.
</p>
<p>gestlings don't really have 'bodies', in the same way kirby and jigglypuff don't really have bodies. it's really more of a floating head in my mind. no time for limbs. but body is a little less ambiguous than something like 'head'

<h3>eyes, body, mouth, and sound</h3>

</p>
<p>a placeholder sound should be visualized with a gestling. eyes, mouth, and body should be animated. states should be parsed from a descript file.
