<h3>mouth animation proof of concept</h3>

<a id="e37a2977"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#e37a2977">#e37a2977</a>.
</p>
<p>results: an animation (no sound) of a mouth, interpolating between at least 2 shapes.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:40:30</b>: this will nicely set the stage for when I start making other Gestling parts, as the animation done here will be very similar to what is required for those. The mouth animation will evolve to be controlled via gesture instead of through lua code.

<h3>mouth animation with gesture proof of concept</h3>

<a id="dbe9ea14"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#dbe9ea14">#dbe9ea14</a>.
</p>
<p>have an animation that is controlled using gesture. there should be sound for this too.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:44:44</b>: a thought on facial expressions: happy/sad faces (curve up/down) can be weights applied to an existing shape. interpolating between the weights smoothly goes between them.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:43:48</b>: scoping gesture control to only be functional, mapping sounds to mouth shapes. anything that's related to facial expressions should be relegated somewhere else.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:43:07</b>: currently thinking there are at least two gestures for mouth control: one that signals open/close, and another for shape.

<h3>work out initial eye designs</h3>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:48:10</b>: depending on how far along the drawing pipeline is, include animation? I'm mainly thinking about ways eyes with an iris can look around at things. perhaps this includes eyes getting larger/smaller/thinner/wider too

<h3>work out initial body designs</h3>

<a id="e3517d0d"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#e3517d0d">#e3517d0d</a>.
</p>
<p>gestlings don't really have 'bodies', in the same way kirby and jigglypuff don't really have bodies. it's really more of a floating head in my mind. no time for limbs. but body is a little less ambiguous than something like 'head'

<h3>eyes, body, mouth, and sound</h3>

<a id="ea0bec5a"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#ea0bec5a">#ea0bec5a</a>.
</p>
<p>a placeholder sound should be visualized with a gestling. eyes, mouth, and body should be animated. states should be parsed from a descript file.
