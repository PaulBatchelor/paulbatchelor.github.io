<h3>bitrune initial editor</h3>

<a id="6534637c"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#6534637c">#6534637c</a>.
</p>
<p>scope out and create bitrune: a text editor for symbols and slabs
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-07-06 20:34:02</b>: some stuff in ortho33 has been reworked. state logic is more decoupled from drawing. there's still a ways to go before it can be used to control the bitrune engine I built.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-06 19:12:31</b>: okay, now going back to ortho33. this needs to be encapsulated so it can actually be re-used.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-06 15:07:43</b>: hoping to finish up the initial engine. at that point, hook up to ortho33 for a curses proof of concept?
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-05 22:33:06</b>: not sure if I'm approaching the problem right, but the code seems slightly more elegant this way because I'm breaking actions up into smaller operations. Insert doesn't do anything but insert a character in the current row/symbol position, and change the length of the row by 1. The right movement updates the symbol position by 1. Both can be used independently.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-05 22:30:12</b>: some initial sketches of code. something that happened while working it out was that "insert" turned into a compound of two verbs: something that actually does the insertion, and then a cursor movement. Without the cursor movement, things gets inserted to the right. So, "A,B,C" inserts would appear "C,B,A".
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-05 18:19:05</b>: A few more words now. I think I have enough here to code some stuff up.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-05 13:54:39</b>: I have started creating words in playground/bitrune/engine.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-05 13:21:02</b>: while it's tempting to jump right to rendering, a part of me first feels like I need to work out the interface and editing backend a little bit more. Creating a clean separation between the input method and the editing engine is going to be important.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-05 13:18:36</b>: there's been lots of off-the-clock casual thinking yesterday. trying to push this into something actionable
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-01 16:11:51</b>: tubular just got done, and I need a way to more interactively sculpt states for it. setting things up well enough for this task would be great.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-01 16:10:21</b>: there's a lot of small components already made here. uf2 font rendering, a proof of concept ortho33 handler, some SDL framebuffer code lying around which is very close to what is needed, etc. the trick is gluing this all together into something cohesive, and to focus things around an MVP that is actually helpful for the Gestlings.

<p><b>2023-07-01 16:12:56</b>: I need a way for tubular to morph between shapes via gesture, we can generalize this to be a table morpher where all the tables are the same size.
