<h2>implement tubular</h2>

<a id="54ee590d"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#54ee590d">#54ee590d</a>.
</p>
<p>tubular aims to be yet another tract physical model, simplified to be one tube without velum, with adjustable size at init-time, and no oversampling.

<p><b>2023-06-30 21:37:54</b>: the interface works with diphone now, so it's more or less in a good place. I think it's ready for the LIL code.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 20:48:20</b>: you know what, the LIL can wait. All I need is enough for a demo, and there's a lot of C code to be made before the LIL code. sndkit's C API is pretty easy to work with, so I'm just going to get the C example working nicely.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 20:11:45</b>: I think it's about nearly time to wrap tubular into a LIL function
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 13:53:53</b>: Going to do add a gentle 1-pole lowpass filter to reduce some of the bright frequencies before downsampling. Doubtful it's 100% "correct", but I think it'll be good enough.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 13:52:59</b>: I found a typo in my code which was causing the NaNs. DRM now works pretty well. Oversampling makes a difference, and now I can control that too!
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 12:55:57</b>: I keep NaNing out with these tract shapes. Why?
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 12:09:46</b>: attempting to hack out the tongue control I use for voc/tractxy to work on any length. If I can get some contrasting phonemes from that, I'll be happy.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-29 21:10:37</b>: it's becoming clear to me that DRM isn't the silver bullet I thought it was for generating tract shapes. Going to experiment a little more, but it's looking like I'll want to make it so multiple empirical techniques are possible.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-29 17:59:36</b>: got some initial sounds. spent some time playing around with DRM shapes. I may want to do some more studies and research here, as it can get quite noisy sometimes (also it sometimes NaNs out). but, I guess it works?
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-29 15:10:23</b>: trying to get an initial implementation. Usually, I wrap things into a LIL function immediately, but writing a C program as an intermediate step using the sndkit API will actually get sound faster.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-29 13:56:06</b>: starting initial boilerplate it mnodes branch
