<p><b>2023-08-11 15:40:25</b>: it's looking like the most foolproof way to render eyes on faces is to everything in one SDF, and use the subtract operator to remove stuff underneath the eyes. I've renamed what I'm calling "registers" to "uniforms" in sdf2d. I'll be adding actual registers to make it easier for shader programs to store masking data for eyes and mouths.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-11 13:05:40</b>: I keep laughing at this bug-eyed gestling pressed up against the glass. worth the time.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-04 22:48:10</b>: depending on how far along the drawing pipeline is, include animation? I'm mainly thinking about ways eyes with an iris can look around at things. perhaps this includes eyes getting larger/smaller/thinner/wider too

</p>
<p>gestlings don't really have 'bodies', in the same way kirby and jigglypuff don't really have bodies. it's really more of a floating head in my mind. no time for limbs. but body is a little less ambiguous than something like 'head'

<h3>eyes, body, mouth, and sound</h3>

</p>
<p>a placeholder sound should be visualized with a gestling. eyes, mouth, and body should be animated. states should be parsed from a descript file.

<p><b>2023-08-13 11:44:23</b>: thinking about making a teaser trailer for gestlings. 4 gestlings singing the gestleton theme song, with a little creepy ritualistic mantra chant thing at the end. I think I'm going to repurpose this task to be about getting one singer working. After that, I'll make another task related to the trailer.

<h3>create XM to gesture conversion proof-of-concept</h3>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-13 17:41:20</b>: got carried away again with the sound a bit, but all 4 voices work with placeholder saws now. I need to swap it out with a tubular instrument, and I think that's a good chunk of the music for this.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-13 12:01:36</b>: going to see where and how far I got with my XM to msgpack converter. I think it works, but it might need to turned into CLI still. I'd like to include it with mnolth.

<h3>make it go 'ya'</h3>

<a id="15423a9e"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#15423a9e">#15423a9e</a>.

<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-14 16:17:41</b>: the time has come to sculpt out the 'yah' shape. I'm going to use tubesculpt to find good 'ee' and 'ah' states for a small tract
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-14 16:16:45</b>: I'm calling this a 'ya'-nvelope generator
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-14 15:30:02</b>: the singers will be able to say one sound: 'ya'. The difficulty with 'ya' is that the 'ah' part is the start of the note, the the 'yi' part. I'm going to attempt to get this timing right via a gesture. The placeholder sound uses a subtractive synthesizer with envelope cutoff. Replacing that envelope with a gesture should yield the correct control signal I'm after. I think.
