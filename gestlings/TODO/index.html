<p><b>2023-08-02 22:56:40</b>: did some brainstorming around this, trying to iron how to best control this. I have this rough notion of using SDFs to draw things for this, but that could use some experiments. in glaslukk
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-28 21:58:51</b>: at the of writing, this is the major component with the most unknowns. There's not a lot of time, so I need to make sure this is all feasible.

<p><b>2023-08-04 14:51:55</b>: create mouth test sheet
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-03 15:50:55</b>: create sdfvm to btprnt region writer
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-03 10:37:35</b>: playing with the SDF library I made, it's making more and more sense to build a little VM abstraction around it. Working on that now.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-03 10:35:59</b>: initial sdf VM
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-02 22:59:40</b>: there's apparently a way to do deformations. I wonder how difficult it'd be to deform a circle to make the 'bean' shape as seen in adventure time
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-02 22:58:52</b>: polygon + rounding had some interesting results. the quadrilateral case could probably get a surprising amount of usage.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-02 13:42:21</b>: I'll need to add the polygon SDF to mnolth, then maybe bring some experiments over here to the gestlings repo
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-02 13:40:56</b>: an idea I've been wanting to try for mouth movement is to use the 2d SDF for a polygon, and then round it.

<h3>initial sdf VM</h3>

<a id="06dc830f"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#06dc830f">#06dc830f</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-03 15:38:34</b>: I've got enough of a VM implemented in sdf2d that I think I can start moving it to mnolth, then cantor, in order to start prototyping mouths in C inside gestlings.
</p>

<h3>create sdfvm to btprnt region writer</h3>

<a id="9a934013"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#9a934013">#9a934013</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-08-04 14:51:22</b>: It's now at a place where I can start coding up an initial mouth with some tests
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-04 14:11:18</b>: getting close to something workable. I'm thinking I'm just going to get it good enough so that it's convenient to make a chart of various mouth test shapes. If I like how it's being used, I'll port it to mnolth or something.
</p>
<p><b>2023-08-03 15:52:50</b>: this should involve reworking the vmdemo example to write to a btprnt region instead of to a buffer. instead of outputing a vec3, just do a scalar and truncate (>0.5 is 1, <0.5 is 0).
