<h2>2. <a id="an-attempt-to-define-a-sigil">An attempt to define a Sigil</a></h2>

<p>In this early stage of notating Gesture, the so-called
"sigil" is perhaps the most important component. It is
the part that conveys the value of the Gesture at
that point in time.
</p>
<p>"Sigil" is a working term at the moment. I like the
associations that come to mind when I use it. It may come
to be that what I refer to as the entire "Gesture Glyph"
may become the "Gesture Sigil". Going to see what happens
naturally. But today, the Sigil is the scalar value component
of the Gesture.
</p>
<p>(Rune perhaps? I like the sound of rune. Runes inside of
sigils.)
</p>
<p>A sigil sits at the center of the glyph. It is the largest
component, given a 16x16 area of pixels. The convention
at the moment will be to treat this as a 7x7 area of tiles
with a 1px margin around it.
</p>
<p>For now, constructed sigils will follow the rules of basic
Square Kufic calligraphy. I very much enjoy the aesthetic of
Kufic, and think it's beauty would be quite applicable to
1-bit pixel art and tesselations (the medium of Gesture
notation).
</p>
<p>Kufic rules state that there must be a balanced amount of
black and white tiles in every area. As a result of this,
there are 4 2x2 tile combinations that cannot exist: all
black, all white, and diagonals/checkerboard (2
combinations).
</p>

<h2>3. <a id="some-notes-for-those-protosigils">Some Notes For Those Protosigils</a></h2>

<p>There's not too much more to say about these so-called
"protosigils". My first instinct, similar
to the <a href="/gestlings/curated_lglyphs">L Glyphs</a>, was to
think about numbers, since those are useful for representing
sets of things like pitches. The first eight sigils were
inspired by the chinese numbers 1-8. The last 4 were
done earlier: a center-oriented diamond, exploring
asymmetry, asymmetry and texture, and a simple nested box.
</p>
<p>These were all sketched by hand initially, which forces one
to move slower. It's definitely a different feeling working
by hand.
</p>

<h2>4. <a id="tangled-code">Tangled Code</a></h2>

<p>The image above was generated using the code below.
This is the first time an attempt has been made to re-use
code in gestlings. This marks the debut of
the <a href="/gestlings/loadtiles">loadtiles</a> utility, which in the future
will be quite helpful in designing the core runeset
(sigilset? glyphset? the terminology is fluid at the
moment).
</p>
<p>The re-usable code that may be extracted from this later
is the <code>gen-tilemap</code> code, a wrapper around loadtiles
that does the extra step of saving it to a new btprnt
buffer.
