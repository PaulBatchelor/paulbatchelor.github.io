<title>Temporal Weight</title>
<h1>Temporal Weight</h1>
<p><code>Temporal Weight</code> is a technique in musical sequencing
that is used to help give notes microtiming. It is
particularly useful in the context of lyricism.
</p>
<p>In the temporal weight system, notes (or, in the context
of Gesture, vertices, nodes, and points), are given mass
which can bend time (tempo) around them like a
gravitational field. As mass increases, tempo increases.
As mass decreases, tempo decreases. A mass can also be
negative, indicating that it the tempo it manipulates
is slower than the original tempo.
</p>
<p>A <code>temporal inertia</code> value can be used to control the
responsiveness to changes in mass. The larger the inertia,
the slower the response.
</p>
<p>Implementing temporal weight in a gesture signal generator
can be done by adding some kind of modulator to the
conductor signal's tempo parameter, and then using a signal
from the GSG to feed back into the modulator and control it.
Inside the GSG program, the state of the current mass and
inertia can be changed every time a new gesture segment
begins.
</p>
<p>The interesting thing about temporal weight is that it is a
concept that requires thinking about Gesture as both a
continuous process in DSP as well as a discrete one in
the GSG program.
