<p><title>The Gesture Path</title>
<h1>The Gesture Path</h1>
</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p>This document implements a Lua interface for create Gesture
Paths for Gesture VM. Paths constructed in Lua eventually
get generated into <a href="/gestlings/tal">tal</a> code.
</p>

<h2>2. What's a "Path"?</h2>

<p>A <b>path</b> is a construct used to describe Gestures. This
is a term borrowed from computer science and graph
theory. A path
can be described as a sequential set of vertices,
connected together by edges. In this context,
a vertice can be thought of as a set of state parameters
for the Gesture Signal Generator: value, behavior, and
rate multiplier. Alternatively, one could also imagine
edges as being weighted by the rate multiplier, but at
the time of writing there hasn't been any usecase for
doing it this way.
</p>
<p>A path is said to be <b>linear</b> if the vertices flow in
one single direction. A path becomes <b>non-linear</b> when this
flow is interrupted somehow, such as with branching.
</p>

<h2>3. Tangled Code</h2>

<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;path.lua&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>local Path = {}

&lt;&lt;path&gt;&gt;
return Path</pre></code>

<h2>4. Creating a Vertex</h2>

<p>The <code>vertex</code> function creates a gesture vertex, represented
as a lua table. The input is an array of 3 values: value,
duration, and behavior.
</p>
<p>Duration is itself a 2-element array containing the numerator
and denominator values for the rate multiplier.
</p>
<p>Behavior is an integer value indicating the type of behavior
to be used. See the <a href="/gestlings/gest#behavior_constants">gest behavior constants</a> for some human-friendly variable
names to use instead of just numbers.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;path&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>function Path.vertex(v)
    x = {}

    x.val = v[1]
    x.dur = v[2]
    x.bhvr = v[3]

    return x
end</pre></code>

<h2>5. Compiling a Path</h2>

<p>A Path, represented as an array of Gesture vertices in
Lua, can be compiled into TAL code using the <code>path</code>function. In addition to the path to be compiled,
the <a href="/gestlings/tal">tal</a> library will need to be passed in,
along with a table to place the words that get generated.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;path&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>function Path.path(tal, words, path)
    for _, v in pairs(path)
    do
        if v.val ~= nil then
            tal.val(words, v.val)
        end

        if v.dur ~= nil then
            tal.dur(words, v.dur[1], v.dur[2])
        end

        if v.bhvr ~= nil then
            tal.behavior(words, v.bhvr)
        end
    end
end
</pre></code>
