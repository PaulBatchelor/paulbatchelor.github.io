<h1>logs</h1>
<p><b>[9baa0868] 2023-01-18-06-11</b>: more words added to (<a href="/gestlings/mseq">mseq</a>) page.
</p>
<p><b>[10a79e91] 2023-01-15-19-54</b>: too much tool mind, so little time. (<a href="/gestlings/mseq">mseq</a>) hastily created. try to get back to (<a href="/gestlings/gestku">gestku</a>) practice.
</p>
<p><b>[fa44eb97] 2023-01-05-06-50</b>: I think I have directed acyclic graphs working, which is a big personal achievement for me. The "rough draft" code has been made, now I am working on creating a literate program for it: (<a href="/gestlings/diagraf">diagraf</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[5b997de0] 2022-12-31-20-48</b>: create (<a href="/gestlings/whistle">whistle</a>) page. the first re-usable synth component created in lua.
</p>
<p><b>[397633ce] 2022-12-31-14-05</b>: I've been taking this vacation time to go on a tool-building "bender". Lots of little lua modules made that should be helpful for later. Will be back onto regular (<a href="/gestlings/gestku">gestku</a>) practice soon hopefully.
</p>
<p><b>[ef3c8d94] 2022-12-31-13-53</b>: creating (<a href="/gestlings/sig">sig</a>) interface. hopefully this will encourage more interesting synthesizers, and should make it easier to make re-usable sound modules.
</p>
<p><b>[2d8c33c7] 2022-12-18-15-48</b>: (<a href="#">morpho</a>) is a DSL for the (<a href="/gestlings/morpheme">morpheme</a>) construct, using LPeg. Documentation is a bit sparse at the moment, but LPeg seems to be a very promising way to build adhoc DSLs. Hopefully I'll be able to build more of these, as they are very fun.
</p>
<p><b>[fd11b75c] 2022-12-17-06-02</b>: create (<a href="/gestlings/weight">weight</a>) page with initial words. more words and examples to come hopefully.
</p>
<p><b>[8614a1c4] 2022-12-17-05-42</b>: working on a new concept: gesture (<a href="#">morphemes</a>). hoping this will quickly get me back to (<a href="/gestlings/gestku">gestku</a>) development. multi-gestures are super important, so I felt it was okay to get derailed this time.
</p>
<p><b>[3581dba9] 2022-12-02-05-44</b>: officially beginning my baby steps into birdsong.
</p>
<p><b>[84f82842] 2022-11-16-06-39</b>: (<a href="/gestlings/runes">runes</a>), diacritics, and L-glyphs come together to make (<a href="/gestlings/sigils">sigils</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[0ec0aa67] 2022-11-10-07-49</b>: more bughunting in weewiki SQLite export. ugh.
</p>
<p><b>[80ecc972] 2022-11-08-06-52</b>: it feels like I've taken a mini vacation from this project. This past weekend I instead built a Euclidean Rhythm Generator. I'll tie it into gesture somehow eventually.
</p>
<p><b>[42fcd8d0] 2022-10-12-06-19</b>: hello. I am setting up the gestlings zet.
