<h1>logs</h1>
<p><b>[5166dc0a] 2023-06-09-21-18</b>: intial goblo code hacked off from (<a href="/gestlings/goblins">goblins</a>) work. trying to ungestku it, then develop a set of morphemes, which will then turn into a vocabulary sequenced by... something
</p>
<p><b>[0fda1b5c] 2023-05-02-16-19</b>: added (<a href="/gestlings/path_grammar">path_grammar</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[1ab71e0c] 2023-05-02-16-05</b>: (<a href="/gestlings/path_symbols">path_symbols</a>), or the start of an approach that is aggressively more notation-oriented
</p>
<p><b>[56d89e2a] 2023-03-06-07-46</b>: initial draft of the creation myth created. See the (<a href="/gestlings/beginning">beginning</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[057d7c22] 2023-02-28-17-21</b>: I just put the usleep in the wrong part of the while loop, causing it to spin tightly. thank goodness. CPU levels are normal now.
</p>
<p><b>[527bd87d] 2023-02-28-14-47</b>: prototyping the grid in lua has a non-trivial amount of overhead (25% CPU all by itself, fans go on). I imagine at some point I will want to build more things in C, but I like starting here first.
</p>
<p><b>[bdb16768] 2023-02-25-13-49</b>: this gestku I've been working on since the 20th... is not a gestku, I've decided. Currently reflecting to see what went wrong, and figure out what it is supposed to be instead.
</p>
<p><b>[5e9e123d] 2023-02-21-06-40</b>: over the past few days, I've been asking myself "what will it take to leave the cauldron?". The answer, I think, is when bits of myth and lore start to emerge from the software I am building
</p>
<p><b>[5a6d4c98] 2023-02-18-14-45</b>: managed to get the (<a href="/gestlings/goblins">goblins</a>) page working to a good enough state. I have a semi-decent way to handle uploading media files like video to my server. Should be a good first start.
</p>
<p><b>[39c8da5c] 2023-01-24-09-47</b>: it's happening... we are adding regression tests for gestkus. Some effort will be taken to try to make sure these don't break or change.
</p>
<p><b>[17f0f032] 2023-01-22-12-56</b>: this is exciting. I'm using sndkit verify with (<a href="/gestlings/warble">warble</a>) for regression testing. Feels a bit stuffy and formal to add testing to a project like this, but I am sure I will think myself later.
</p>
<p><b>[9baa0868] 2023-01-18-06-11</b>: more words added to (<a href="/gestlings/mseq">mseq</a>) page.
</p>
<p><b>[10a79e91] 2023-01-15-19-54</b>: too much tool mind, so little time. (<a href="/gestlings/mseq">mseq</a>) hastily created. try to get back to (<a href="/gestlings/gestku">gestku</a>) practice.
</p>
<p><b>[fa44eb97] 2023-01-05-06-50</b>: I think I have directed acyclic graphs working, which is a big personal achievement for me. The "rough draft" code has been made, now I am working on creating a literate program for it: (<a href="/gestlings/diagraf">diagraf</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[5b997de0] 2022-12-31-20-48</b>: create (<a href="/gestlings/whistle">whistle</a>) page. the first re-usable synth component created in lua.
</p>
<p><b>[397633ce] 2022-12-31-14-05</b>: I've been taking this vacation time to go on a tool-building "bender". Lots of little lua modules made that should be helpful for later. Will be back onto regular (<a href="/gestlings/gestku">gestku</a>) practice soon hopefully.
</p>
<p><b>[ef3c8d94] 2022-12-31-13-53</b>: creating (<a href="/gestlings/sig">sig</a>) interface. hopefully this will encourage more interesting synthesizers, and should make it easier to make re-usable sound modules.
</p>
<p><b>[2d8c33c7] 2022-12-18-15-48</b>: (<a href="/gestlings/morpho">morpho</a>) is a DSL for the (<a href="/gestlings/morpheme">morpheme</a>) construct, using LPeg. Documentation is a bit sparse at the moment, but LPeg seems to be a very promising way to build adhoc DSLs. Hopefully I'll be able to build more of these, as they are very fun.
</p>
<p><b>[fd11b75c] 2022-12-17-06-02</b>: create (<a href="/gestlings/weight">weight</a>) page with initial words. more words and examples to come hopefully.
</p>
<p><b>[8614a1c4] 2022-12-17-05-42</b>: working on a new concept: gesture (<a href="#">morphemes</a>). hoping this will quickly get me back to (<a href="/gestlings/gestku">gestku</a>) development. multi-gestures are super important, so I felt it was okay to get derailed this time.
</p>
<p><b>[3581dba9] 2022-12-02-05-44</b>: officially beginning my baby steps into birdsong.
</p>
<p><b>[84f82842] 2022-11-16-06-39</b>: (<a href="/gestlings/runes">runes</a>), diacritics, and L-glyphs come together to make (<a href="/gestlings/sigils">sigils</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[0ec0aa67] 2022-11-10-07-49</b>: more bughunting in weewiki SQLite export. ugh.
</p>
<p><b>[80ecc972] 2022-11-08-06-52</b>: it feels like I've taken a mini vacation from this project. This past weekend I instead built a Euclidean Rhythm Generator. I'll tie it into gesture somehow eventually.
</p>
<p><b>[42fcd8d0] 2022-10-12-06-19</b>: hello. I am setting up the gestlings zet.
