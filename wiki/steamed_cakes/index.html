<h1>Steamed Cakes</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This recipe describes the making of a steamed cake, small
enough to fit in steam cooker such as the Tatung Steam
Cooker.
</p>
<p>The Base Recipe will outline the core ingredients, as
well as the procedure. Underneath are a few variations
I've enjoyed making that are derived from the base
recipe.
</p>

<h2>The Base Recipe</h2>


<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p>60g Cake Flour
</p>
<p>5g Baking Powder
</p>
<p>32g Sugar
</p>
<p>9g Oil
</p>
<p>1 Egg
</p>
<p>45g Milk
</p>
<p>Vanilla Extract (~1/2 to 1 tsp, unmeasured)
</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>Add all dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl, and
whisk until combined.
</p>
<p>Add in the oil into the mixed dry ingredients (this is
known as reverse creaming). Whisk until the oil is
mixed in. This should have a kind of crumbly consistency.
</p>
<p>Mix in the egg.
</p>
<p>Mix well, then add in vanilla. Mix a little more.
</p>
<p>Pour mix into greased 6-inch round cake pan.
</p>
<p>Place in steam cooker and let it steam. For the Tatung,
I used 1.5 cups of water using their measuring cup.
</p>
<p>Cake is done when the surface is springy to the touch.
Remove and let cool. Remove and enjoy!
</p>
<p>Strawberry Jam or similar is recommended. Goes well
with tea.
</p>

<h2>Variation One: Double Chocolate</h2>

<p>Add 10g cocoa powder (I use black cocoa or dutched cocoa
such as hershey's special dark)
</p>
<p>Double the oil to 18g.
</p>
<p>Before pouring into the cake pan, sprinkle in some
chocolate chips into the mix. Approximately 2 tablespoons
should do.
</p>
<p>Pairs well with vanilla ice cream and/or a glass
of milk.
</p>

<h2>Variation Two: Cinnamon Molasses</h2>

<p>This Cinnamon Molasses cake is inspired by Pennsylvania
Dutch cuisine such as the shoo-fly pie.
</p>
<p>Instead of conventional white sugar, use brown sugar.
</p>
<p>New ingredients:
</p>
<p>8g brown sugar
</p>
<p>7g Cinnamon
</p>
<p>1/4 tsp nutmeg (about 1g or less, couldn't measure it on my
scale)
</p>
<p>36 grams molasses
</p>
<p>Served best with a jam, such as strawberry jam. Goes well
with tea.
