<h1>Homemade no-knead baguettes</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>700 grams flour
</p>
<p>1.5 teaspoons instant yeast
</p>
<p>2 teaspoons salt
</p>
<p>530 grams water
</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>Mix flour, salt, and yeast together.
</p>
<p>Gradually mix in water, but <b>DO NOT KNEAD</b></p>
<p>When mix is goopy, set aside and let rise for about 2
hours. Then, gently punch it down and place in container.
Dough should have a sticky almost cottage cheese like
texture to it (weird). Refrigerate overnight.
</p>
<p>The next day, take dough out onto floured surface and
divide into 5 sections (5 future loaves). Take the
ones you want to use, and refridgerate the rest for later.
</p>
<p>Take each bit of dough and fold it into itself once. Gently
roll into a ball. Place in a warm environment and let rise
for about 45 minutes.
</p>
<p>For final shaping: gently press down on the dough ball, and
begin folding into the center. Use the heel of your hand to
fold in half. Roll into a long skinny snake. Place in a
baguette pan, or a makeshift one using a floured cloth and
heavy objects to keep it in place. Let this rise for about
1.5-2 hours.
</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 450F.
</p>
<p>Gently lift baguettes onto baking sheet. Score the tops
with a knife. Spray with water.
</p>
<p>In the oven, place a baking sheet with boiling water
on the bottom shelf, and place oven below.
</p>
<p>Bake for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown.</p>
