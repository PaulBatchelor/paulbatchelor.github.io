<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-14 09:56:01</b>: wrote out tips on a sauce. gonna upload a draft to my writing folder so it isn't on my freewrite anymore.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-12 09:16:24</b>: some initial writing on the pasta making. now to work on the the sauce part.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 10:13:43</b>: inspired by the essay-recipe format I found in 'cooking of the lamb' for puff paste. At this point, I have many opinions about pasta making that I'd like to articulate. will probably begin writing it up on my freewrite at some point.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-08 20:07:25</b>: took some pictures today of the rolling and cutting. not sure if I want to add pictures of the dough making process. this could be good enough.
