<h1>Homemade Tortellini</h1>
<p>WIP. This recipe will outline a meat tortellini recipe with
using fresh pasta.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>There are two big parts to making Tortellini: the filling,
and then the pasta rolling/wrapping. My recipe is based off
the one found in How to Cook Everything.
</p>
<p>Making tortellini is a time-consuming dish. It is
recommended to make filling ahead of time, and to block
out a good chunk time to roll up the tortellini.
</p>

<h2>Making The Meat Filling</h2>

<p>At this point, I eyeball the meat filling. It's a
combination of ground meat (I use sausage and hamburger),
chicken stock, a cooking wine of sorts (sherry is nice),
parmesan cheese, with some spices thrown in like
basil and oregano. An egg (or two) is thrown in
to bind everything together, and bread crumbs are used if
things end up too liquid. The ideal thing is to end up
with something ideal.
</p>
<p>To begin, I first cook the ground meats separately, then
I add some cooking wine and let that boil off, the cooking
stock next and let the boil off, then the parmesan, and
then finally egg and crumbs.
</p>
<p>Here it is, bubbling away. You'll want that liquid to
boil off, or add more bread crumbs.

<h2>Pasta-Work</h2>

<p>The most characteristic part of the Tortellini is its
shape: a very distinct set of folds and wraps which
takes a single square of pasta and turns it into a
crescent encasing a bit of meat filling.
</p>
<p>The pasta itself is dough made from my <a href="/wiki/pasta">fresh eggless pasta recipe</a>.
</p>
<p>The dough is rolled out to have a thickness of around 2-3mm.
It's a little bit thicker than the fettucine I make.
</p>
<p>I use a square cookie cutter to cut
up the individual squares. Probably about 2 to 2.25 inches?
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/tortellini/cutting_squares.jpg">
</p>
<p>I also have this really nice 1/2 teaspoon measure that is
shaped as a half-sphere (like a tiny melon baller?). This
is really good for scooping out filling.
</p>
<p>The procedure for creating tortellini is as follows:
</p>
<p>Take a square, and brush water on top of it. This will
make it a bit sticky, and more cohesive.
</p>
<p>Scope out a little bit of filling and place it in the
center as a ball (this picture has it a bit squashed).
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/tortellini/filled.jpg">
</p>
<p>Fold opposite corners together to enclose the filling
inside of a triangle. Firmly press on the edges to seal
it up. Try not to tear the pasta.
</p>
<p>You now should have an isosceles triangle with a long base.
Arrange things so the base fases upwards, with the corner
pointing down.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/tortellini/triangle_better.jpg">
</p>
<p>Take the corner pointing down, and fold it upwards towards
the filling. Crarefully press it so that it sticks in
place. Dip your fingers in water if it isn't sticky.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/tortellini/fold_triangle.jpg">
</p>
<p>The remaining corners "ears" or "arms". Take the ear-arms,
and fold them over the "head", pinching them together.
</p>

</p>
<p>Keep doing this, and eventually you'll get a plate of them:

<h2>Cooking</h2>

<p>To cook tortellini, throw into boiling water. When they are
done, they will float to the surface.
</p>
<p>Optionally, one can choose to lightly fry the tortellini.
Thoroughly drain the excess water (this is <b>important</b>.
water going into hot oil can easily kickstart grease fires.
Guess how I know this?) and place tortellinis into a
skillet with oil. Rotate frequently and cook until it
is an ideal shade of brown.
</p>

</p>
<p>I also like to fry these with a bechamel cheese sauce,
such as the one used in my <a href="/wiki/pasta">pasta</a> recipe.
