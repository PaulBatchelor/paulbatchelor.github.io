<h1>Homemade Tortellini</h1>
<p>WIP. This recipe will outline a meat tortellini recipe with
using fresh pasta.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>There are two big parts to making Tortellini: the filling,
and then the pasta rolling/wrapping. My recipe is based off
the one found in How to Cook Everything.
</p>
<p>Making tortellini is a time-consuming dish. It is
recommended to make filling ahead of time, and to block
out a good chunk time to roll up the tortellini.
</p>

<h2>Making The Meat Filling</h2>

<p>At this point, I eyeball the meat filling. It's a
combination of ground meat (I use sausage and hamburger),
chicken stock, a cooking wine of sorts (sherry is nice),
parmesan cheese, with some spices thrown in like
basil and oregano. An egg (or two) is thrown in
to bind everything together, and bread crumbs are used if
things end up too liquid. The ideal thing is to end up
with something ideal.
</p>
<p>To begin, I first cook the ground meats separately, then
I add some cooking wine and let that boil off, the cooking
stock next and let the boil off, then the parmesan, and
then finally egg and crumbs.
</p>

<h2>WIP: Pasta-Work</h2>

<p>The most characteristic part of the Tortellini is it's
shape: a very distinct set of folds and wraps which
takes a single square of pasta and turns it into a
crescent encasing a bit of meat filling.
</p>
<p>The pasta itself is dough made from my <a href="/wiki/pasta">fresh eggless pasta recipe</a></p>
