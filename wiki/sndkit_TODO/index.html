<h1>sndkit TODO</h1>
<p>A dynamically generated list of public-facing TODO items for
<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>. The TODO list is managed using this
wiki's <a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a>, using the state <code>TODO-sndkit</code>.

<h3>swell</h3>

<p>a special parameter smoothing filter with different weights based on direction, and inertia.
<blockquote>
<b>2021-01-30 16:10:31</b>: while writing this, I actually wrote out the signal flow which made it a lot clearer. It would be a really prime candidate for something to write in pikchr.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-30 16:09:37</b>: the initial words have been written, along with most of the logic. Coding it up should be a mostly mechanical process.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>biramp</h3>

<p>biramp is a process that takes a phasor ramp signal, and converts it to a bidirectional ramp with adjustable position.
<blockquote>
<b>2021-01-30 11:36:18</b>: most of the words/logic have been written. now it's just code.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-30 11:36:05</b>: biramp is a utility that adds turns an incoming phasor signal into a bidirectional ramp.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>clkphs</h3>

<p>given a clock signal, produce an approximate phasor signal.
<blockquote>
<b>2021-01-30 16:39:15</b>: I do have words written up for this. It's definitely been a less important thing to do over time.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>sparsenoise</h3>

<p>sparsenoise is will fire off random impulses. pretty much velvet noise I think?
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>use pikchr to draw diagrams in sndkit</h3>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>clock-synced delay</h3>

<p>this is basically a variable delay line that stays in sync via an external clock signal.
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>stringer</h3>

<p>stringer is a string resonator filter
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>highshelf</h3>

<p>high shelf filter based on the audio EQ cookbook
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>lowshelf</h3>

<p>low shelf filter based on the audio EQ cookbook
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>valp4</h3>

<p>valp4 is a Virtual-Analogue Low-Pass 4-pole filter
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>paulstretch</h3>

<p>an implementation of the famous paulstretch algorithm. this code already exists in soundpipe, it just needs to be rewritten as a literate program.
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>cflooper</h3>

<p>a cross-fade looping sampler with adjustable crossfade times and pitch control.
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>jitseg</h3>

<p>jitseg hopes to be a jitter signal generator
