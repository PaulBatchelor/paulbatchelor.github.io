<h3>sndkit API proof of concept</h3>

<a id="b1f42943"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#b1f42943">#b1f42943</a>.
</p>
<p>build enough of a C API for sndkit to generate a sine wave oscillator with vibrato and write it to a WAV file.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-14 17:29:49</b>: build up core API
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-14 17:29:18</b>: create sine node
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-14 17:28:15</b>: create scale node
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-14 17:25:57</b>: create scale algo
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-14 17:25:32</b>: in addition to the core C API, this needs 3 nodes: a sine wave oscillator, a biscaler, and a wavout module.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h4>create scale algo</h4>

<a id="eda00fca"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#eda00fca">#eda00fca</a>.
</p>
<p>a general purpose scaling equation to scale input values between min and max to be output values min and max.

<h4>build up core API</h4>

<a id="dd80dc9c"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#dd80dc9c">#dd80dc9c</a>.
</p>
<p>implement initial C API for sndkit. Just enough for proof of concept, which basically is just being able to manage parameters.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-21 18:19:33</b>: wav file and sine wav works! good initial hello world. next is to add biscale so there is vibrato.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 14:10:57</b>: we call it core. duh!
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 12:12:24</b>: also, I think I'm going to refer to this thing as a sndkit-patchwerk bridge rather than an API. APIs imply some sort of centralization, and this really isn't what I'm trying to do here. It's really about making patchwerk a little bit easier to use based on my experience using it with monolith and runt.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 12:10:23</b>: some initial coding. mainly fleshing out what my words had written. the bare minimum needed is the stack interface, and some things to create and destroy everything.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 10:50:51</b>: imported document from traveler. will begin working on this on my computer now.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 08:10:24</b>: last week or so I wrote up some initial words on this. should probably look back at it.

<h3>use pikchr to draw diagrams in sndkit</h3>

<a id="d4da5c0c"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#d4da5c0c">#d4da5c0c</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-12 09:34:52</b>: the hard part in pikchr is learning the syntax. but I do have a simple usecase that would be very helpful. <a href="/sndkit/swell">swell</a> is filter that is very easy to explain with a flowchart.

<h3>jitseg</h3>

<a id="004ac67a"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#004ac67a">#004ac67a</a>.
</p>
<p>jitseg hopes to be a jitter signal generator
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-12 09:29:44</b>: no, there is no initial writings on this. I will have to fix that.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-12 09:28:11</b>: do I even have any words for this yet?
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-07 09:53:08</b>: jitseg is actually a very small algorithm that will end up being under 100 lines of C. shouldn't be too hard to right about. the most complex part is the internal RNG to write about.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-31 10:53:50</b>: there is some initial working code for this. maybe even a few words and outlines.

<h3>FM4</h3>

<a id="76f74cad"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#76f74cad">#76f74cad</a>.
</p>
<p>a 4 operator FM voice designed to be highly flexible.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-12 09:40:03</b>: I want this FM oscillator to be keep me interested for a while. Each operator should be able to take in wavetables of arbitrary size. I should also be able to morph between an arbitrary set of wavetables, possibly with arbitray sizes. Feedback control will be a global knob. Since I want different configurations, it seems like any other solution would be too messy.

<h3>create LPF algorithm</h3>

<a id="5583c640"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#5583c640">#5583c640</a>.
</p>
<p>create a resonante lowpass filter based on the one found in ChucK. Works great for making click sounds.

<h3>create coding conventions page</h3>

<a id="8f5d9cc6"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#8f5d9cc6">#8f5d9cc6</a>.
</p>
<p>There are definitely patterns and conventions that I follow. It would be good to create a formal page on this to document the consistency.

<h3>create fixed-point phasor page.</h3>

<a id="ec374b7d"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#ec374b7d">#ec374b7d</a>.
</p>
<p>this component is used so frequently, it would be helpful to have an informational page about this.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-10 15:59:06</b>: this should be a fixed vs floating point phasor page. the key difference is how the phasor is reset. fixed point is a bit more efficient. Beyond that, the two are pretty identical.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-07 10:16:16</b>: lots of older computer music algorithms use fixed point precision phasors, and I have no intention of updating those to be floating point. what I'm interested in is: is it worth the trouble using fixed point on new algorithms?
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-07 10:15:17</b>: I've been saying that it is less prone to weird numerical errors compared to floating point. I don't know how true that actually is. Will look into it.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-07 10:14:37</b>: I'm going to get to the bottom of this: is a fixed point phasor actually meaningful in any way on modern hardware and compilers?

<h3>create page that explains what is meant by *normalized range*.</h3>

<a id="ba617253"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#ba617253">#ba617253</a>.
</p>
<p>the concept of a normalized range keeps coming up consistently, and it would be good to have a page that explains what it is and why it is important.

<p>given a clock signal, produce an approximate phasor signal.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-01-30 16:39:15</b>: I do have words written up for this. It's definitely been a less important thing to do over time.

<h3>lowshelf</h3>

<a id="016662a5"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#016662a5">#016662a5</a>.
</p>
<p>low shelf filter based on the audio EQ cookbook
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-01-31 11:02:47</b>: from an educational standpoint, it might be useful to structure the writeup so that it starts with the math equation, and ends up in C code.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-31 11:02:09</b>: all it is is a biquad filter with the right coefficients. The coefficients would come from the audio EQ cookbook, which I've already rewritten in TeX for myself. Those could be a nice part of the page.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-31 11:01:08</b>: a low shelf filter is more useful to me than a high shelf filter right now, so this comes first.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-12 09:19:23</b>: I wrote a comment about this, but on the wrong task. will pirkle has a C++ implementation that is worth examining. It is from the same Art of VA filter design book. My version would ported to ANSI C, and of course would give credit to Pirkle.

<h3>cflooper</h3>

<a id="a1e9dfbb"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#a1e9dfbb">#a1e9dfbb</a>.
</p>
<p>a cross-fade looping sampler with adjustable crossfade times and pitch control.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-01-31 10:59:19</b>: If I can't figure out continuous adjustment, having something that dynamically produces a crossfade at run-time is good enough I guess. Since I added (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>), I've been able to mess around with samples before and being able to turn any sound into a seamless texture is exciting to me.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-31 10:57:38</b>: I already have a static crossfade loop generator (<a href="/wiki/cfloop">cfloop</a>). I want this one to have seamlessly adjustable crossfade looping abilities. Being able to do that continuously without clicks is what is interesting to me. I'm sure there may be a clever way to do this, I just haven't figured it out.
