<h2>add RNG to sndkit core</h2>

<a id="2674354c"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#2674354c">#2674354c</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>

<h2>create bitcrush algo</h2>

<a id="f2945ac3"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#f2945ac3">#f2945ac3</a>.
</p>
<p>the current soundpipe module is broken and not worth repair (totalled). it would be better to build another one from scratch.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-03-30 22:01:20</b>: should downsampling be a normalized value so that it can be sample-rate independant? I'm going to say no for now because the soundpipe bitcrush wasn't.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-30 21:59:02</b>: yeah. I think that makes sense. bit depth all comes down to reducing noise floor. and noise floor happens as you strip away bits that are LSB. it was just a bit counter-intuitive for me for some reason.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-30 21:56:52</b>: bit reduction can be done with a shift I think? but is it really about losing LSBs?
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-30 21:53:58</b>: downsampling is done via a sample and hold. the counter can be managed using a phasor. aliasing is desired.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-30 21:51:29</b>: a bitcrusher actually does two things: it truncates the bit depth, and it downsamples. Both are done in an intentionally crude way.

<h2>add error codes to sndkit core</h2>

<a id="317b788d"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#317b788d">#317b788d</a>.
</p>
<p>it is going to be difficult to know what goes wrong when things go wrong. adding specific error codes with canned messages will make life easier.

<h2>cflooper</h2>

<a id="a1e9dfbb"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#a1e9dfbb">#a1e9dfbb</a>.
</p>
<p>a cross-fade looping sampler with adjustable crossfade times and pitch control.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-01-31 10:59:19</b>: If I can't figure out continuous adjustment, having something that dynamically produces a crossfade at run-time is good enough I guess. Since I added (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>), I've been able to mess around with samples before and being able to turn any sound into a seamless texture is exciting to me.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-31 10:57:38</b>: I already have a static crossfade loop generator (<a href="/wiki/cfloop">cfloop</a>). I want this one to have seamlessly adjustable crossfade looping abilities. Being able to do that continuously without clicks is what is interesting to me. I'm sure there may be a clever way to do this, I just haven't figured it out.

<h2>growl</h2>

</p>
<p>GROWL is a kind of vowel filter. Would be a good first speech synthesis thing to have: https://github.com/paulbatchelor/GROWL
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-23 16:51:26</b>: a good initial stab words for this. there are a lot of smaller components, so slow and steady wins the race.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-23 16:25:32</b>: fast tracking this sndkit algo because it is in the spirit of (<a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">toys_not_tools</a>). everyone loves a good vowel filter, and hoping this can be the starting point for building generative articulation engines for vocal synthesis.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 08:33:47</b>: components for this include resonator filters, balancers, and a dc blocker.

<h2>blep</h2>

<a id="629c4e3f"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#629c4e3f">#629c4e3f</a>.
</p>
<p>a BLEP oscillator based on an implementation by Taylor Holliday
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-23 10:16:38</b>: normally, I prefer to write words before code. but since the code is already written, I've found this approach is less messy.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-23 10:15:43</b>: I'm finally going to get around to doing this. I have the original C++ code. I will rewrite it in ANSI C, then put it inside of a literate program.

<h2>lowshelf</h2>

<a id="016662a5"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#016662a5">#016662a5</a>.
</p>
<p>low shelf filter based on the audio EQ cookbook
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-01-31 11:02:47</b>: from an educational standpoint, it might be useful to structure the writeup so that it starts with the math equation, and ends up in C code.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-31 11:02:09</b>: all it is is a biquad filter with the right coefficients. The coefficients would come from the audio EQ cookbook, which I've already rewritten in TeX for myself. Those could be a nice part of the page.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-31 11:01:08</b>: a low shelf filter is more useful to me than a high shelf filter right now, so this comes first.

</p>
<p>this component is used so frequently, it would be helpful to have an informational page about this.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-10 15:59:06</b>: this should be a fixed vs floating point phasor page. the key difference is how the phasor is reset. fixed point is a bit more efficient. Beyond that, the two are pretty identical.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-07 10:16:16</b>: lots of older computer music algorithms use fixed point precision phasors, and I have no intention of updating those to be floating point. what I'm interested in is: is it worth the trouble using fixed point on new algorithms?
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-07 10:15:17</b>: I've been saying that it is less prone to weird numerical errors compared to floating point. I don't know how true that actually is. Will look into it.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-07 10:14:37</b>: I'm going to get to the bottom of this: is a fixed point phasor actually meaningful in any way on modern hardware and compilers?

<p><b>2021-02-12 09:40:03</b>: I want this FM oscillator to be keep me interested for a while. Each operator should be able to take in wavetables of arbitrary size. I should also be able to morph between an arbitrary set of wavetables, possibly with arbitray sizes. Feedback control will be a global knob. Since I want different configurations, it seems like any other solution would be too messy.
