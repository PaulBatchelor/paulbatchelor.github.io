<title>Monolith</title>
<h1>Monolith</h1>
<p>Monolith is the name of an interactive computer music
ecosystem that I have written for myself.
#
</p>
<p>Monolith is mainly a bunch of C components built to be
controlled inside of a fork of
<a href="https://www.t3x.org/s9fes/">s9 scheme</a>. The s9 REPL is then
set to spawn inside of emacs scheme interpretor. From there,
the rest of the workflow is controlled via emacs.
</p>
<p>Scheme code can evaluate <a href="/proj/runt">Runt</a> code, which
is then used to generate sound via
<a href="/proj/patchwerk">Patchwerk</a>.
</p>
<p>Monolith source code is managed using a private Fossil
repo, but a mirror of the code can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/monolith">github</a>.
