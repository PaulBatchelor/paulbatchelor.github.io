<title>Monolith</title>
<h1>Monolith</h1>
<p><a href="/proj/monolith">Monolith</a> is the name of an interactive
computer music ecosystem that I have written for myself.
</p>
<p>Monolith is mainly a bunch of C components built to be
controlled inside of a fork of
<a href="https://www.t3x.org/s9fes/">s9 scheme</a>. The s9 REPL is then
set to spawn inside of emacs scheme interpretor. From there,
the rest of the workflow is controlled via emacs as a live
coding environment.
</p>
<p>Scheme code can evaluate <a href="/proj/runt">Runt</a> code, which
is then used to generate sound via
<a href="/proj/patchwerk">Patchwerk</a>.
</p>
<p>Monolith is designed to be tightly coupled with the
monome <a href="/wiki/monome_grid">Grid</a> and
<a href="/wiki/arc">Arc</a> hardware, as well as the
<a href="/wiki/griffin">griffin powermate</a>. Multiple
applications utilizing these peripherals can exist at once
in Monolith using what are known as <b>pages</b>.
</p>
<p>In adddition to sound, monolith has the ability to produce
small bitmap graphics. H264 encoded video can be produced
using libx264. This interface is notably used in the
<a href="/wiki/breathing_cards">Breathing Cards</a> series.
</p>
<p>In addition to scheme, there are also language bindings to
the <a href="/wiki/janet">Janet programming language</a>. A
local version of Janet is embedded in the monolith system.
</p>
<p>Monolith source code is managed using a private Fossil
repo, but a mirror of the code can be found on
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pbatch/monolith">sourcehut</a>.
