<title>BTPRNT</title>
<h1>BTPRNT</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>"btprnt", or "bitprint", or "bitmap printer", is a
library for generating monochrome bitmap graphics.
</p>
<p>An initial implementation can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/btprnt">github</a>.
</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>BTPRNT will be used to generate informational charts and 
outlines, as well as musical scores. I can imagine these
being used in "postcard form" to give summaries of some
projects and ideas.
</p>
<p>The codebase will be designed to be simple and portable.
</p>
<p>Aesthetic is another important aspect as well. I like the
sharpness of monochrome pixel art. It reminds me of the
elegence seen on the old macintosh computers.
</p>
<p>One feature that I am hoping to implement is the idea of
an infinite canvas. This is something I feel like I am
missing in my toolset.
</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>

<p>Here is the plan as I see it in my head today.
</p>

<h4>Part 1: intial API</h4>

<p>Begin writing the core API. This includes textbox primitives
(with integer scaling), as well as some basic drawing
routines (lines, rectangles, circles, rounded rectangles,
etc).
</p>

<h4>Part 2: Janet Integration</h4>

<p>UPDATE: This is now available in
<a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/monolith/tree/master/lib/btprnt">monolith</a>.
</p>
<p>This step involves creating bindings for the <a href="/wiki/janet">Janet</a> language.
</p>
<p>At this point, BTPRNT should be ready for some work! My hope
is to initially use BTPRNT for things like generating
outlines, diagrams, and visual documentation.
</p>
<p>Janet would be used to build larger more useful programs on
top of the core BTPRNT C library. For the time being, the
intention is to manage this separately from the BTPRNT
codebase, and perhaps maintain it in <a href="/wiki/monolith">Monolith</a>.
</p>

<h4>TODO Part 3: Simple Interaction</h4>

<p>The idea here is to build some interactive interfaces in a
platform neutral sort of way, and then building an example
that uses it with an SDL backend. Sliders, buttons, and XY
pads will probably be one of the first things to appear. The
idea is to mimic <a href="/wiki/puredata">PD</a> a little bit
here. The infinite canvas concept will be important here.
Somehow, users will be able to move to items offscreen. I
also envision having a form of hyperlinks that allows
jumping to specific locations.
</p>

<h4>TODO Part 4: Intermediate Interaction</h4>

<p>Actually getting btprnt to be used in an application
setting. It would be cool to build interactive canvases that
can help drive sounds made in <a href="/wiki/monolith">Monolith</a>. I'm imagining something in between
<a href="/wiki/puredata">PD</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">hypercard</a>.
These would be read-only displays for now, generated using
some kind of markup or scriping language.
</p>

<h4>TODO Part 5: Advanced Interaction</h4>

<p>Get the BTPRNT interactive graphics to the point where
things can be created/deleted/modified on-the-fly. The
testing ground will be in Monolith.
</p>

<h3>Bitmap font tilesets</h3>

<p>Found some good bitmap font resources here:
</p>
<p><a href="http://uzebox.org/wiki/Font_Bitmaps">http://uzebox.org/wiki/Font_Bitmaps</a> is a collection
of fonts of various sizes.
</p>
<p><a href="http://kofler.dot.at/c64/font_01.html">http://kofler.dot.at/c64/font_01.html</a> is a gigantic
collection of fonts from the commodore64
(mostly 8x8).
</p>
<p>It would be fair to say that discovering these motivated me
to try and build something like BTPRNT.
