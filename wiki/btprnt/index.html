<h1>BTPRNT</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>"btprnt", or "bitprint", or "bitmap printer", is a
library for generating monochrome bitmap graphics.
</p>
<p>An initial implementation can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/btprnt">github</a>.
</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>BTPRNT will be used to generate information charts and mind
maps, as well as musical scores. I can imagine these being
used in "postcard form" to give summaries of some projects
and ideas.
</p>
<p>The codebase will be designed to be simple and portable.
</p>
<p>Aesthetic is another important aspect as well. I like the
sharpness of monochrome pixel art. It reminds me of the
elegence seen on the old macintosh computers.
</p>
<p>One feature that I am hoping to implement is the idea of
an infinite canvas. This is something I feel like I am
missing in my toolset.
