<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>"btprnt", or "bitprint", or "bitmap printer", is a
library for generating monochrome bitmap graphics.
</p>
<p>An initial implementation can be found on
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pbatch/btprnt">sourcehut</a>.
</p>
<p>btprnt is written as a <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate program</a>, and an HTMLized version of the
program can be found <a href="/wiki/btprnt_program">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>There is a charming aesthetic to 1-bit graphics. Typically
they are black and white, which is a nostalgic throwback to
the classic Macintosh era: a more elegant time for
computers.
</p>
<p>A 1-bit graphics library, written properly, can be very
simple, portable, and hopefully last a while.
</p>
<p>Lots of embedded devices use 1-bit OLED pixel displays are
popping up now like the <a href="/wiki/arduboy">arduboy</a>, the
<a href="/wiki/norns">norns</a>, and more recently the <a href="#">Daisy Pedal</a>. Having a portable library that could work
in these restricted systems would be very helpful.
</p>

<h3>Current Roadmap</h3>

<p>Here is the plan as I see it in my head today.
</p>

<h4>DONE Part 1: intial API</h4>

<p>Begin writing the core API. This includes textbox primitives
(with integer scaling), as well as some basic drawing
routines (lines, rectangles, circles, rounded rectangles,
etc).
</p>

<h4>DONE Part 2: Janet Integration</h4>

<p>UPDATE: This is now available in
<a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/monolith/tree/master/lib/btprnt">monolith</a>.
</p>
<p>This step involves creating bindings for the <a href="/wiki/janet">Janet</a> language.
</p>
<p>At this point, BTPRNT should be ready for some work! My hope
is to initially use BTPRNT for things like generating
outlines, diagrams, and visual documentation.
</p>
<p>Janet would be used to build larger more useful programs on
top of the core BTPRNT C library. For the time being, the
intention is to manage this separately from the BTPRNT
codebase, and perhaps maintain it in <a href="/wiki/monolith">Monolith</a>.
</p>

<h4>TODO Part 3: Simple Interaction</h4>

<p>The idea here is to build some interactive interfaces in a
platform neutral sort of way, and then building an example
that uses it with an SDL backend. Sliders, buttons, and XY
pads will probably be one of the first things to appear. The
idea is to mimic <a href="/wiki/puredata">PD</a> a little bit
here. The infinite canvas concept will be important here.
Somehow, users will be able to move to items offscreen. I
also envision having a form of hyperlinks that allows
jumping to specific locations.
</p>

<h4>TODO Part 4: Intermediate Interaction</h4>

<p>Actually getting btprnt to be used in an application
setting. It would be cool to build interactive canvases that
can help drive sounds made in <a href="/wiki/monolith">Monolith</a>. I'm imagining something in between
<a href="/wiki/puredata">PD</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">hypercard</a>.
These would be read-only displays for now, generated using
some kind of markup or scriping language.
</p>

<h4>TODO Part 5: Advanced Interaction</h4>

<p>Get the BTPRNT interactive graphics to the point where
things can be created/deleted/modified on-the-fly. The
testing ground will be in Monolith.
</p>

<h3>Bitmap font tilesets</h3>

<p>Found some good bitmap font resources here:
</p>
<p><a href="http://uzebox.org/wiki/Font_Bitmaps">http://uzebox.org/wiki/Font_Bitmaps</a> is a collection
of fonts of various sizes.
</p>
<p><a href="http://kofler.dot.at/c64/font_01.html">http://kofler.dot.at/c64/font_01.html</a> is a gigantic
collection of fonts from the commodore64
(mostly 8x8).
</p>
<p>It would be fair to say that discovering these motivated me
to try and build something like BTPRNT.
</p>

<h3>Monolith</h3>

<p>A copy of btprnt has been included in <a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>,
with a bunch of extra features. This includes <a href="/wiki/janet">janet</a> bindings, a high-level layout utility, a classic
macintosh font renderer, an audio file renderer (similar to
the algorithm used by <a href="https://audacityteam.org">Audacity</a>),
and more!
</p>
<p>As Monolith gets more documentation, the idea is to use
btprnt to generate charts and reference cards like these:
</p>
