<h1>WeeWiki</h1>
A weewiki page about weewiki!

<h2>Syncing Pages</h2>

First a page must be created. Right now, this can be done
with:
<br>
<br>
Write some stuff, then quit. Then link with an external
file:
<br>
<br>
Now, the page can be externally edited and tracked.
<br>
Any new changes in the pages of the wiki can be
bidirectionally synchronized with:
<br>

<h2>A bootstrap setup</h2>

Note: now that sync is utilized, this should not be used.
<br>
The following describes a bootleg weewiki sync setup using
only push/pull commands and shell scripts.

<h3>mkwiki</h3>

On a new system, the wiki database must be bootstrapped.
<br>
This will take all the external org files and push
them to the database.

<h3>push</h3>

A mass <code>push</code> operation will update the internal pages to be
the external pages.

<h3>pull</h3>

A mass <code>pull</code> operation will update all external pages
to be what is stored internally.

<h2>Hopes</h2>


<h3>HTML Export</h3>

In the near future, my hope is to be able to
export this to HTML. Then in-line scripting,
then full wiki export.

<h3>Scripting</h3>

<h2>WeeWiki Github</h2>

WeeWiki source coded is maintained using
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org">Fossil</a>, but has been exported to
a read-only git repo for convenience.
