<h1>WeeWiki</h1>
A weewiki page about weewiki!
<br>

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a tiny scriptable wiki engine designed to build
personal mind maps.
<br>
The core engine is written in C via the
<a href="/proj/worgle">Worgle</a> literate programming environment.
<br>
Wiki pages are primarly stored inside of a SQLite database,
and are written using org syntax (presumably via org-mode
and emacs). The org parsing is done via a custom parser,
written in C.
<br>
On top of the core engine is a scripting environment.
For this, the <a href="https://janet-lang.org">Janet language</a> is
used. Janet code can be run inside of a wiki page, and
can be used to dynamically generate org content, which
is then turned into HTML by the parser. This can be
used to do things like create dynamic reference links,
such as <a href="/wiki/weewiki.html">this one!</a><br>

<h2>WeeWiki On Github</h2>

WeeWiki source coded is maintained using
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org">Fossil</a>, but has been exported to
a read-only git repo for convenience.
<br>
The repository in question can be found at:
<a href="https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/weewiki.git">https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/weewiki.git</a>.

<h2>Usage</h2>


<h3>Creating a page</h3>

This can be done <code>weewiki add foo</code>, where <code>foo</code> is the name
of your page.

<h3>Editing a page</h3>

To edit a page, run <code>weewiki edit foo</code>. This will create a
page called foo and open it up inside of the text editor set
by <code>EDITOR</code>.

<h3>Deleting a page</h3>

Should be <code>wiki del foo</code>, where <code>foo</code> is the name of the
page.

<h3>Syncing Pages</h3>

Page syncing is a way to edit and manage pages externally.
<br>
An (existing) page can be linked with
<code>weewiki link foo foo.org</code>.
<br>
Now, the page can be externally edited and tracked.
<br>
Any new changes in the pages of the wiki can be
synchronized with:
<br>
<br>
Synchronization works by comparing the modification
time of the external file with the one stored in the
link table, and will choose the newest to overwrite
the entry in the database and the external file. Keep in
mind that this is a simple overwrite with no fancy merging.

<h3>A bootstrap setup (deprecated)</h3>

<b>Note</b>: now that sync is utilized, this should not be used,
but, I'm leaving it up anyways.
<br>
The following describes a bootleg weewiki sync setup using
only push/pull commands and shell scripts.

<h4>mkwiki</h4>

On a new system, the wiki database must be bootstrapped.
<br>
This will take all the external org files and push
them to the database.

<h4>push</h4>

A mass <code>push</code> operation will update the internal pages to be
the external pages.

<h4>pull</h4>

A mass <code>pull</code> operation will update all external pages
to be what is stored internally.
