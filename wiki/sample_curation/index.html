<h1>Sample Curation</h1>

<h3>The Sample Curation Problem</h3>

<p>A on-going problem of mine: how does one efficient manage
or curate a large database of samples?
</p>
<p>My compositions up to this point in time have been largely
vacant of samples for this reason. I do have sample
collections, I always find myself overwhelmed when it comes
to choosing a sample. How do I know when I have found the
"right" sample? And what happens if I find a good sample,
but I don't have a use for it? I don't have a good system
in place, so sample selection for me comes down to either
random selection, panick-y random trial and error, or just
what is most convenient (first one selected, selection from
a arbitrarily limited subset, etc).
</p>

<h3>A Potential Solution</h3>

<p>For many years now, I figured I could use SQLite somehow,
especially with the use of something like
<a href="/wiki/sqlar">sqlar</a>.
</p>
<p>Using SQLar with <a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a> is the fist
step. They both speak SQLite, and weewiki utilize Janet
scripting to make custom interfaces a programs geared
for sample curation. The Org format of the wiki provides
a structure to write notes a sample collection in
a free-form way. This freedom is important for this sort of
creative task. It's hard to know what a system will look
like until you try it out.
</p>
<p>Wiki pages and scripts can be managed using Fossil, an SCM
that also gets saved to a SQLite database.
</p>
<p>In the future, my hope is to develop an interface that
allows one to easily tie an arbitary amount of keywords and
notes to a particular sample, to be saved as a structure
inside of the database. WeeWiki pages + Janet Scripts
could then be used to dynamically display said content.
