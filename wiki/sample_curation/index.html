<h1>Sample Curation</h1>

<h2>The Sample Curation Problem</h2>

<p>A on-going problem of mine: how does one efficient manage
or curate a large database of samples?
</p>
<p>My compositions up to this point in time have been largely
vacant of samples for this reason. I do have sample
collections, I always find myself overwhelmed when it comes
to choosing a sample. How do I know when I have found the
"right" sample? And what happens if I find a good sample,
but I don't have a use for it? I don't have a good system
in place, so sample selection for me comes down to either
random selection, panick-y random trial and error, or just
what is most convenient (first one selected, selection from
a arbitrarily limited subset, etc).
</p>

<h2>A Potential Solution</h2>

<p>For many years now, I figured I could use SQLite somehow,
especially with the use of something like
<a href="/wiki/sqlar">sqlar</a>.
</p>
<p>Using SQLar with !@(ref "weewiki" "weewiki")</p>
