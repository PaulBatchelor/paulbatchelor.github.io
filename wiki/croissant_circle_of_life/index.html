<title>The Croissant Circle of Life</title>
<h1>The Croissant Circle of Life</h1>
<p>The various life stages of a <code>Croissant</code>.
Based on a Mastodon thread I made.
</p>
<p>Dedicated to
<a href="https://cblgh.org/">cblgh</a>, who strongly hinted that I
should put this on my wiki. And how could I let them down?
</p>

<h2>Larval Stage</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/larval.jpg">
</p>
<p>And so it begins. The initial croissant dough. A mix of
flour, water (at <b>just</b> the right temperature), yeast,
salt, sugar, and butter (of course).
</p>
<p>Now it needs to rise and grow up.
</p>

<h2>Adolescence</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/adolescence.jpg">
</p>
<p>In a warm nurturing environment, our larval being has grown,
and maybe learned some things along the way!
</p>
<p>The dough now gets de-gassed and will rest overnight in the
fridge. This helps develop the gluten in the dough.
</p>

<h2>Fertility</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/fertile.jpg">
</p>
<p>The butter slab was made a few days before I started this.
It is now taken out of the fridge to warm up a bit. It needs
to be become more malleable and plastic to match the dough.
It is nearly "fertile" here.
</p>

<h2>Coupling</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/coupling.jpg">
</p>
<p>The dough gets rolled out and cut into two rectangles that
occupy the same area as the butter slab. Here the slab is
placed on top of one of them.
</p>

<h2>Mating</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/mating.jpg">
</p>
<p>A butter-dough sandwich! It's important to make sure there's
equal coverage.
</p>

<h2>First Gestation</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/gestate1.jpg">
</p>
<p>The sandwich is rolled out approximately 60cm and then
folded. This is the first fold. Then it is placed in the
fridge to chill out. This firms up the butter and further
develops the gluten.
</p>

<h2>Second Gestation</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/gestate2.jpg">
</p>
<p>Rotate 90 degrees, roll out ~60cm, then fold back up again.
This is the second fold. Back in the fridge it goes.
</p>

<h2>Third Gestation</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/gestate3.jpg">
</p>
<p>Same process as before. This is the third and final fold.
Back into the fridge for about an hour.
</p>

<h2>Spawning</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/spawning.jpg">
</p>
<p>The dough is rolled out and cut into triangles to be rolled
into croissants.
My croissants are teeny weeny, which is why I cut my dough
sheet in half.
</p>

<h2>Grouping</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/grouping.jpg">
</p>
<p>The freshly rolled croissants are placed on a baking sheet
to be flash frozen in a freezer. They are only kept in for
half an hour or so just to firm them up for more long-term
storage.
</p>

<h2>Hibernation</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/hibernation.jpg">
</p>
<p>The croissants are packed in for their long-term slumber.
Freezing pre-baked croissants works out really well, and can
mean fresh morning croissants for days/weeks!
</p>

<h2>Awakening</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/awakening.jpg">
</p>
<p>For these three croissants, their moment has come. The night
before, croissants are taken out of the fridge and placed on
a cooking sheet. These little fellas are going to "wake up"
and rise, doubling in size.
</p>

<h2>Rehydration</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/rehydration.jpg">
</p>
<p>Once placed on a cooking sheet, the frozen croissants are
ready to be proofed. The sheet is placed on the middle rack
of a cold oven. Underneath, boiling water is placed on a
sheet. This is left overnight.
</p>

<h2>Lactation</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/lactation.jpg">
</p>
<p>In the morning, the proof croissants are lightly brushed
with milk right before going in. This gives them a nice
brown finish.
</p>

<h2>Adulthood</h2>

<p><img src="/res/wiki/croissant_circle_of_life/adulthood.jpg">
</p>
<p>14 minutes later, and the croissants are done! These will
cool slightly, and then be consumed. Yum.
