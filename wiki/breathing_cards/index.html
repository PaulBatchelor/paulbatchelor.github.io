<title>The Breathing Cards</title>
<h1>The Breathing Cards</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The breathing cards are a series of short audio-visual
etudes. I call them "cards" because of their small size
being like postcards. Cards are breathing because they are
temporal (audio + video), rather than static.
</p>
<p>In many ways, this is a
distant relative to the <a href="/sporthlings">sporthlings</a> series.
</p>
<p>Each video is produced using 128x64 sized canvas, with
magnification applied in post.
</p>
<p>The soundtrack is of equal (if not more) importance than
what is being seen visually. The idea is to have sounds
"bleed" onto the visual canvas.
</p>
<p>Cards are made using the <a href="/proj/monolith">monolith</a> computer music ecosystem.
</p>
<p>Here are some cards, hosted on vimeo:
