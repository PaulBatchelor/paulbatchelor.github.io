<h2>use gest to morph between vowel states</h2>

</p>
<p>formant synthesis or physical model, the idea is the same: use gest to morph between two vectors intsead of two scalars.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-07-26 20:45:50</b>: the goal right now is to meld (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) with a vowel filter via (<a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>) using scheme bindings. an instance of the vowel filter and gest would be created. the gesture would then be populated using custom target commands that integrate with the vowel filter. then, the gest node is created, followed by the vowewl filter.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-26 17:18:14</b>: I've refactored some of the target and behavior components to set the groundwork for this. behaviors now only deal with remapping the position, and mixing between two target values is handled in another callback. The trick now will be to glue my vowel filter I am working on with gest, and make it so the mix stage interpolates phoneme states in addition to the default scalar values.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-23 20:55:12</b>: gest doesn't need to allocate the vectors, it just needs to reference them.

<h2>brainstorm: best approachs for generative things in gest</h2>

<a id="a374f64c"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#a374f64c">#a374f64c</a>.
</p>
<p>ideally, it would be great for gestures to produce phrases on the fly, or to have some degree of randomness in how phrases are performed. initial thoughts go here.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-07-26 20:47:35</b>: the last target in a phrase needs to know about the first target in the next phrase. so, if phrases are being created on-the-fly, it needs to be created with that last target begins.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-23 20:43:31</b>: setting up the "next value in a phrase to be a callback instead of a value would allow some more dynamic on-the-fly things to happen. meta-phrases, such as the ability to choose between phrases would be good too. maybe something similar for targets? more thinking required.

<h2>add error correction and checking</h2>

<a id="9a44852a"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#9a44852a">#9a44852a</a>.
</p>
<p>there are no checks for drift in place, so drift will eventually happen with this implementation. first figure out the kind of errors currently being experienced, then strategize and implement some approaches to mitigate this for long-term compositions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-07-26 17:19:10</b>: I think I put in some work into this while debugging something. will need to revisit, but I thinkt it's non-zero work.
