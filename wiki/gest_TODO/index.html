<h2>can linear monoramps be warped?</h2>

<a id="b1421292"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#b1421292">#b1421292</a>.
</p>
<p>my thinking here is that if you could apply things like exponentially mapping to monoramps, it could serve as an opportunity to introduce pockets of nonlinear rhythms that would be invisible.

<h2>brainstorm: best approachs for generative things in gest</h2>

<p>ideally, it would be great for gestures to produce phrases on the fly, or to have some degree of randomness in how phrases are performed. initial thoughts go here.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-08-23 20:32:52</b>: with a little bit of modification, this could be a dynamic part of gest. generating phrases on-the-fly is far more complicated, as it would require a memory scheme, and a way to generate the phrases that could be realtime friendly.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-23 20:31:43</b>: the next thing after this would be somehow sequences of ramptrees contained inside a monoramp. or something. rhythmic phrases within a contained duration.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-23 20:29:42</b>: a good way to creak open the door here would be to create sequences of targets. that is to say, have a target really be a fixed array of targets, and sequetionally go through them every time the phrase loops.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-26 20:47:35</b>: the last target in a phrase needs to know about the first target in the next phrase. so, if phrases are being created on-the-fly, it needs to be created with that last target begins.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-23 20:43:31</b>: setting up the "next value in a phrase to be a callback instead of a value would allow some more dynamic on-the-fly things to happen. meta-phrases, such as the ability to choose between phrases would be good too. maybe something similar for targets? more thinking required.
