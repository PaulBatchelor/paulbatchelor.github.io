<h2>make it possible to group and playback a sequence of phrases in a metaphrase</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-09-22 09:01:22</b>: rationale for this: looping back on specific metathings causes state to change in a meaningful way

<h2>make it possible to have metaphrases repeat using gest_repeat</h2>

<a id="ac7bcab3"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#ac7bcab3">#ac7bcab3</a>.
</p>
<p>as of writing, using gest_repeat on a metaphrase doesn't seem to work

<h2>make it possible to manually AND automatically seed gest RNG using the sndkit RNG, all from LIL</h2>

<a id="c3d98d68"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#c3d98d68">#c3d98d68</a>.
</p>
<p>gestcoreseed in LIL, which can take a constant value, or a value generated with the sk RNG (which isn't possible yet)

<h2>create gest interface for wavetable morphing</h2>

<a id="7000478d"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#7000478d">#7000478d</a>.
</p>
<p>this would be an interface built in gest that would allow an instance of (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) to morph between wavetable states, in a similar fashion to what is being done with <a href="/sndkit/tract">tract</a> in monolith

<h2>can linear monoramps be warped?</h2>

<a id="b1421292"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#b1421292">#b1421292</a>.
</p>
<p>my thinking here is that if you could apply things like exponentially mapping to monoramps, it could serve as an opportunity to introduce pockets of nonlinear rhythms that would be invisible.

<h2>brainstorm: best approachs for generative things in gest</h2>

<a id="a374f64c"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#a374f64c">#a374f64c</a>.
</p>
<p>ideally, it would be great for gestures to produce phrases on the fly, or to have some degree of randomness in how phrases are performed. initial thoughts go here.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-08-23 20:32:52</b>: with a little bit of modification, this could be a dynamic part of gest. generating phrases on-the-fly is far more complicated, as it would require a memory scheme, and a way to generate the phrases that could be realtime friendly.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-23 20:31:43</b>: the next thing after this would be somehow sequences of ramptrees contained inside a monoramp. or something. rhythmic phrases within a contained duration.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-23 20:29:42</b>: a good way to creak open the door here would be to create sequences of targets. that is to say, have a target really be a fixed array of targets, and sequetionally go through them every time the phrase loops.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-26 20:47:35</b>: the last target in a phrase needs to know about the first target in the next phrase. so, if phrases are being created on-the-fly, it needs to be created with that last target begins.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-23 20:43:31</b>: setting up the "next value in a phrase to be a callback instead of a value would allow some more dynamic on-the-fly things to happen. meta-phrases, such as the ability to choose between phrases would be good too. maybe something similar for targets? more thinking required.
