<blockquote>
<p><b>2023-10-30 10:47:06</b>: I have to say, I've been in a bit of a mario mood. Those games just seem so well polished in terms of game design.
</p>
<p><b>2023-10-30 10:46:16</b>: Some new games I've dabbled with recently are "The Lost Vikings" (SNES), "Vectorman", and "Yoshi's Island". I'm also quite fond of the arcade version of Bomb Jack (gameboy port is also nice too).
</p>
<p><b>2023-10-30 10:43:19</b>: Stilling gaming reguarly, though I haven't been good about updating this log. My current "usuals" have been Majoras Mask, Windwaker, Link to the Past, Link's Awakening (GBC version, should probably get back to Switch), Kirby Nightmare in Dreamland, Kirby's Adventure (NES), and Kirby's Dreamland 3 (SNES)
</p>
<p><b>2023-10-30 10:39:58</b>: I finally got all the eggs and learned that bossa song in MM.
</p>
<p><b>2023-10-30 10:39:23</b>: Yesterday, October 29th, at approximately 19:40, I beat Kirby Nightmare in Dreamland. It was a game played on my new Analogue Pocket over the course of a few days. This game has no saves, so I used save states.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-13 11:11:55</b>: In Link's Awakening, I'm now slightly farther ahead in the GBC version than the Switch version. I needed to look at the Nintendo Power guide for help.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-09 16:54:31</b>: snowhead temple finished. goht's mask acquired. I wasn't actually expected to beat this boss on the first go, but I did. This was probably the most fun I've had with any Zelda boss. It felt like a mini mario kart track.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-08 12:09:35</b>: finished portal 2 today yay
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-08 12:09:09</b>: beat the laughing guy, got the boss key. Figured that was enough for today. It's pretty neat the way you are able to move through these dungeons incrementally while still going back in time to reset.
</p>
<p><b>2023-07-03 14:30:05</b>: some slight progress at snowhead in majoras mask. I'm now at the top floor, with that laughing guy again.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 16:43:30</b>: While I'm thinking about saving, FFVII is hard for me to play for a number of reasons, but having to wait for the next save point isn't great for me in 2023.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 16:42:25</b>: well, actually 2 games have save including Landstalker. My sample size isn't all that big, now that I think about it.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 16:41:13</b>: I've played a few games on the Genesis, and only one of them has a "save feature". Is saving games a weird thing? Am I missing something?
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 16:40:22</b>: initial impressions on "Landstalker": this is Generic Brand Legend of Zelda, like actually. The isometric graphics are neat. I'm getting used to the controls. I played until I died, and couldn't figure out how to save? There's a very long intro that I haven't figured out how to skip. Will probably need to look up some manuals to actually play this thing.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-30 15:47:34</b>: I've been recommended the game Landstalker. "If you into link to the past, you gotta pick up Tom Rogers' face Landstalker". Downloaded the ROM and loading it on the MiSTer without any idea what this game is or what it's about.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-27 22:03:46</b>: Finished Portal today. Finally. Only took me 10 years. Only, this time it was on a Swith with a nice controller. A much better experience than WASD.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-22 20:08:19</b>: oh! and big news today as well: I purchased Portal 1 + 2 for the Switch. It's been over a decade since I played those games. I don't even think I finished them. Time to revisit.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-22 20:03:10</b>: Briefly tried out Wipeout XL for PSX on my MiSTer. It definitely more closely resembles Wipeout64 than Wipeout. Wipeout64 is still the better game.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-22 19:58:54</b>: have to admit, I also peaked at the nintendo power guide for majora's mask. Just a peak though. I'm not getting any younger.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-22 19:57:17</b>: in general, this game so far really forces the novel game mechanics to the player without really giving many hints. I guess I'm spoiled by newer games like TotK and BotW where the mechanics feel smooth and organic.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-22 19:55:14</b>: finally broke down and looked at the nintendo power strategy guide for windwaker to unstick myself from the first island where I had to get the sail (erp. that was embarassing.)
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-21 11:16:56</b>: DOOM progress: managed two levels last night: Phobos Anomaly and Deimos Anomaly. Died somewhere in the Containtment Area level.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-21 11:15:09</b>: Simpson Hit and Run: I am stuck on the roadkill collection one with Cletus.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-20 16:52:35</b>: okay, that was a bit rapid-fire today. hopefully I'll land into a routine that's a bit more regular.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-20 16:51:32</b>: I've now taken a several-month hiatus from Dark Souls after finishing a boss I was stuck on for literally months. I got cursed, and need to uncurse myself. It's amazing how much intertia is required to do that plus physical swap out the cartridge on my switch.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-20 16:49:40</b>: I think I'm beginning to make something of a dent in DOOM chapter 1. I just reached 'Phobos Anomaly'. Didn't know what to expect, got nervous seeing all the health/ammo, and was promptly destroyed by those centaur demon thingies.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-20 16:47:34</b>: metroid fusion is coming along on my modded GBA. It's a nice game to play in short bursts when I have a few moments.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-20 16:45:25</b>: I've been pretty regularly playing the PS1 port of DOOM on my MiSTer. Also, currently reading the DOOM Black Book in the mornings. So, lotsa DOOM.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-20 16:41:12</b>: I've been passively trying to keep up with other zelda games: Wind Waker, Majora's mask, and Link To the Past. I was dual playing Link's awakening on GBC and Switch, but now I'm conflicted about where to play the GBC version.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-20 16:39:12</b>: Personally, I find myself very the "explore the world" kind of player. I do like quests too. I feel like I'm a very basic neurotypical player.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-20 16:36:28</b>: TOTK has been out for about a month or so now. I've had it about that long. I haven't tuned into the community much, but many are having fun with the physics sandbox of it. It makes me think of it as a highly polished minecraft.
</p>
<p><b>2023-06-20 16:35:15</b>: have not been doing a good job posting about my gaming. the issue is I've been playing many games at once, for only short periods. so, I move very very slowly.
</p>
<p><b>2023-04-05 11:23:29</b>: I really need a rotation log, and groups for each game. Have I mentioned this already?
</p>
<p><b>2023-04-05 11:22:56</b>: lots of metroid fusion lately. the GBA is a convenient form factor for quick bursts of gaming. Action Button Review recommended Metroid Prime for Gamecube, so I tried that out yesterday.
</p>
<p><b>2023-03-04 13:39:05</b>: I've gotten a nugget couch for myself. Finding it's a nice way to play GBA games. Put in about another half-hour of Metroid Fusion.
</p>
<p><b>2023-03-04 13:37:59</b>: OOT: I am in Ganons castle. Majora's Mask: I have discovered the monkeys. A good reference to Link's Awakening. Despite my hesitations, I find myself growing to like this game. It's hard to come up with something after OOT.
</p>
<p><b>2023-03-04 13:35:04</b>: yesterday, I got wii roms working via USB loader. took a lot of trial and error, as well as guidance hidden in various forums and websites with varying degrees of accuracy. gosh, for a minute I thought I was back in 2008 installing Linux.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-26 20:27:14</b>: eternal darkness: spent a few minutes on this today. I went in completely blind, and had no idea what to expect. I'm still in the first level, and things feel like a point and click adventure at the moment. It's not exactly holding my attention at the moment, but I like the vibe of it.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-26 20:25:24</b>: mario sunshine: played the first few minutes. the pacing feels weird... it takes too long to "wash out" a monster. the voice acting is weird, but Jen Taylor is Peach so that's cool.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-26 20:21:48</b>: actraiser: actually gave it some time. it's starting to click now. really enjoying it.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-25 13:51:17</b>: At some point, my childhood N64 had an expansion pak put into it. I discovered this accidentally when I tried playing Majora's Mask for the first time ever this morning. Very surreal and dark compared to OOT. Was hesitant at first, but I'm getting into it. This might be a good game.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-19 17:30:43</b>: I've been indulging myself with Simpson's Hit and Run. There are so many much much better games for the GC I should be playing, but alas. Nostalgia strikes again.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-19 17:29:07</b>: I forgot to mention: I played 10 minutes of Ecco the Dolphin on the MiSTer on I friday. I played this game on my RG350 months ago for about the same period of time. It's a really beautiful game. The music, the graphics, the procedurally generated sound effects. I have no idea what I'm doing in this game, but I'm loving it!
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-19 17:25:35</b>: made it to ganadorfs castle in OOT today. I'm proud of you for making it this far, Link.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-19 17:24:14</b>: Dipped a toe into Actraiser for the SNES. I did not understand the interface, and had to look up how to get to the platform part. Once I got past that, it seemed pretty cool. I dig the music.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-18 14:43:21</b>: Between the MiSTer, the N64, the GBA, and the Wii, I'd say I have a pretty massive potential library of games to check out with a "no emulation" kind of experience, spanning nearly 3 decades of gaming history. It's a little intimidating to think about.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-18 14:41:05</b>: yesterday was also a quite notable, as I managed to revive an old Wii yesterday to play gamecube games on it via the Homebrew channel and Nintendont. Simpsons Hit and Run was the first game I tested (for nostalgia reasons).
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-18 14:38:59</b>: I've been told Metroid involves a lot of backtracking. Nothing encapsulates that more than in the opening parts (level? stage?) of Metroid for NES. Still a lot to learn and play.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-16 08:39:04</b>: everyone has been telling me to play metroid, so this morning I played like the first 5 minutes of metroid fusion on my GBA. Love the graphics. Feels great to play so far.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-12 14:28:30</b>: I'm ashamed to say I had to look up how to open the spirit temple boss door today. It turns out, I was very close. I fell from the platform the first time and the mirrors reset. It would have taken me a while to notice that.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-12 10:06:29</b>: I have a big skew towards Kirby. I love the aesthetic of those worlds. I was thinking about the character design of Kirby. It's the bare-minimum, form-wise. One step up from pacman. In-game, Kirby is literally a "void" that is filled up by the colorful world they inhabit.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-12 10:03:40</b>: more MiSTer experiments yesterday: dig dug (Arcade/MAME), Doom (rev1) on PSX, Bubble-Bobble port for the C64. I think I would have had more fun with the C64 if I had a better keyboard setup (and had more time to learn how to use the C64).
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-11 15:48:52</b>: I have now had my MiSTer for 3 days, and am slowly comprehending just how many games this enables me to play. It is a little overwhelming...
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-11 15:45:53</b>: I like the phrase "gamelog" because you can say it like how you same "gamelan", which makes me giggle. Also, if you read it as gameLAN it doesn't not make any sense.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-11 15:44:20</b>: to recap: dark souls remastered (switch), link's awakening (trying to parallel play switch/GBC), Kirby's Adventure (NES), Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland (GBA), Bomb Jack (Arcade), Legend of Zelda: OOT (N64).
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-11 15:39:10</b>: At the request of my friend, I have started a gaming log. Here I will write about videogames I play.
