<p><b>2023-02-11 15:48:52</b>: I have now had my MiSTer for 3 days, and am slowly comprehending just how many games this enables me to play. It is a little overwhelming...
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-11 15:45:53</b>: I like the phrase "gamelog" because you can say it like how you same "gamelan", which makes me giggle. Also, if you read it as gameLAN it doesn't not make any sense.
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-11 15:44:20</b>: to recap: dark souls remastered (switch), link's awakening (trying to parallel play switch/GBC), Kirby's Adventure (NES), Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland (GBA), Bomb Jack (Arcade), Legend of Zelda: OOT (N64).
</p>
<p><b>2023-02-11 15:39:10</b>: At the request of my friend, I have started a gaming log. Here I will write about videogames I play.
