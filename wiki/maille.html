<h1>Maille</h1>
<p>Maille, also known as ring maille, chain maille, and
sometimes incorrectly spelled as "mail", is a form of
weaving, consisting of interlocking metal rings to form a
cloth-like mesh. Maille is most often associated as
a form of armor used in medieval times. In more modern
contexts, maille is more of a craft than a war device,
though the material is sometimes used for certain
industrial usecases.
