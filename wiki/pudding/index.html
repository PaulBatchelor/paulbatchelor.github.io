<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p>3 cups milk, ideally whole or 2 percent
(I use 1 12oz can of condensed milk mixed 1:1 with water)
</p>
<p>2/3 cups sugar
</p>
<p>2/3 cups Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder
</p>
<p>1/4 cup powdered whole milk
</p>
<p>5 tablespoons cornstarch
</p>
<p>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>Loosely mix ~2 cups milk, sugar, cocoa powder, and powdered
milk into sauce pan. In a separate bowl, mix the remaining
~1 cup milk 5 tablespoons of corn starch.
</p>
<p>Turn on medium low heat on the sauce pan, and blend things
well together with a whisk. An electric whisk is highly
recommended. Use a spatula to scrape any dry bits into the
mix.
</p>
<p>Wait until things begin to steam in the saucepan, then mix
in the cornstarch milk mix and butter. Turn the heat to low.
</p>
<p>Continuously stir with spatula in a slow motion. Do this
until the pudding begins to thicken. On the first sign of a
bubble, transfer to a covered bowl and refrigerate. To avoid
any skin, it is ideal to do the transfer quickly, and to mix
the pudding in the bowl to break up the surface.
</p>
<p>Wait a few hours for it to cool, then serve.</p>
