<h2>Description</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">twtxt</a> is a
simple decentralized microblogging platform.
tweets are written in a specially formatted timestamped
text file, which are then published online using some kind
of file server.
</p>
<p>Right now, I am using <a href="https://github.com/mdom/txtnish">txtnish</a> to interface with twtxt.

<h4>2019-10-15 12:11:56</h4>

<p>weewiki org parser is getting a little bit better. fun bits are long gone, and now it is just tedious bugfixing.
</p>

<h4>2019-10-10 12:58:18</h4>

<p>finally hacked ijanet up to behave like the scheme REPL. very excited about this!
</p>

<h4>2019-10-09 18:47:56</h4>

<p>thank you sean costello for teaching me how to make planetarium music
</p>

<h4>2019-10-09 15:14:36</h4>

<p>physical models are wild animals that are never meant to be domesticated
</p>

<h4>2019-10-08 14:09:21</h4>

<p>after a month hiatus, I am getting back into some low level norns work. 8x8 bitmap fonts look real good on this thing
</p>

<h4>2019-10-05 22:37:51</h4>

<p>gameboy color speaker replaced using ds lite speaker. sounds quieter than I expected. but better than no sound at all. this, combined with the new case I got for it, makes it almost feel like a brand new device :)
</p>

<h4>2019-10-05 14:31:31</h4>

<p>should also note that I have been traveling a lot recently, so the heavy speakers do not travel with me. it is difficult to get re-acquainted with them for this reason.
</p>

<h4>2019-10-05 14:29:03</h4>

<p>even though I have these nice hs7 studio monitors on my desk right now, most of my monitoring has been done using my minirig mini. There is just something so irresistable about writing music for something so cute and tiny.
</p>

<h4>2019-10-05 13:11:57</h4>

<p>listening richard devine's new album sort/lave today. of course the sounds are top notch, but I really am enjoying how 'composed' it all feels. it really demonstrates true mastery of modular environments.
</p>

<h4>2019-10-04 10:05:24</h4>

<p>postcard sized art is such a lovely scale for the visual medium. attempting to imagine the sound/temporal version of that
</p>

<h4>2019-09-30 10:29:10</h4>

<p>planck keyboard feels 98% natural to me now. I'm using stiff tactile grey cherry switches on them, which feel great to me, but my fingers need to build up strength for long-term use.
</p>

<h4>2019-09-30 10:24:43</h4>

<p>lol build broke. see ya later rx.
</p>

<h4>2019-09-30 10:21:28</h4>

<p>rx pixel editor looks seen on HN today looks interesting to me (and the sort of thing I've wanted to build), but the vulkan support seems like overkill. Also, my graphics cards drivers are broken on Alpine, so the program probably won't run. trying anyways.
</p>

<h4>2019-09-28 20:56:50</h4>

<p>when composing, it can be hard to know what is good or crap, so you just have to power through it
</p>

<h4>2019-09-28 17:05:29</h4>

<p>added paragraph blocks and code blocks to weewiki HTML output. things look decent.
</p>

<h4>2019-09-27 16:13:37</h4>

<p>it is time to add a test suite for orgparse/weewiki.
</p>

<h4>2019-09-26 13:13:23</h4>

<p>statically generated my twtxt feed here: https://pbat.ch/wiki/twtxt.html. learning how to be social on this thing comes next.
</p>

<h4>2019-09-26 12:45:13</h4>

<p>gears seem to turn okay.
</p>

<h4>2019-09-26 12:42:23</h4>

<p>seeing if auto-publisher works out on other computer
</p>

<h4>2019-09-26 12:38:57</h4>

<p>testing auto-publish
</p>

<h4>2019-09-26 12:32:39</h4>

<p>testing out auto-generation of twtxt wiki page now
</p>

<h4>2019-09-26 12:29:35</h4>

<p>Tweeting from MBP now.
</p>

<h4>2019-09-26 12:20:52</h4>

<p>Tweeting from GPD pocket now
</p>

<h4>2019-09-25 17:26:23</h4>

<p>Maybe it's just me getting older, but there is something very satisfying about seeing big chunky text on screen. Currently using an Atari font on my computer. Once your eyes get used to it, it's actually quite lovely.
</p>

<h4>2019-09-25 08:27:50</h4>

<p>the best vacations are the ones in your mind
</p>

<h4>2019-09-25 08:26:22</h4>

<p>trying out script. not instant upload, but that's probably for the best
</p>

<h4>2019-09-25 08:12:38</h4>

<p>right now, it's a three step process for me to tweet and upload. gotta make it just one.
</p>

<h4>2019-09-25 08:10:08</h4>

<p>I could see me using this. Just need to figure out the best workflow for making 'tweets'.
</p>
