<h1>TWTXT</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">twtxt</a> is a
simple decentralized microblogging platform.
tweets are written in a specially formatted timestamped
text file, which are then published online using some kind
of file server.

gameboy color speaker replaced using ds lite speaker. sounds quieter than I expected. but better than no sound at all. this, combined with the new case I got for it, makes it almost feel like a brand new device :)

should also note that I have been traveling a lot recently, so the heavy speakers do not travel with me. it is difficult to get re-acquainted with them for this reason.

even though I have these nice hs7 studio monitors on my desk right now, most of my monitoring has been done using my minirig mini. There is just something so irresistable about writing music for something so cute and tiny.

listening richard devine's new album sort/lave today. of course the sounds are top notch, but I really am enjoying how 'composed' it all feels. it really demonstrates true mastery of modular environments.

postcard sized art is such a lovely scale for the visual medium. attempting to imagine the sound/temporal version of that

planck keyboard feels 98% natural to me now. I'm using stiff tactile grey cherry switches on them, which feel great to me, but my fingers need to build up strength for long-term use.

rx pixel editor looks seen on HN today looks interesting to me (and the sort of thing I've wanted to build), but the vulkan support seems like overkill. Also, my graphics cards drivers are broken on Alpine, so the program probably won't run. trying anyways.

when composing, it can be hard to know what is good or crap, so you just have to power through it

Maybe it's just me getting older, but there is something very satisfying about seeing big chunky text on screen. Currently using an Atari font on my computer. Once your eyes get used to it, it's actually quite lovely.

trying out script. not instant upload, but that's probably for the best
</p>
<b>2019-09-25 08:12:38</b></p>
right now, it's a three step process for me to tweet and upload. gotta make it just one.
</p>
<b>2019-09-25 08:10:08</b></p>
I could see me using this. Just need to figure out the best workflow for making 'tweets'.
