<h1>Fossil</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Fossil is a source-code management system. It was originally
built to manage <a href="#">SQLite</a> in a similar way
that git was built to manage the Linux kernel.
</p>
<p>In addition to managing source code, Fossil features an
integrated bug-tracking system, wiki, and web-based UI.
</p>
<p>A Fossil repo is stored as a single SQLite archive which is
extracted into an active workspace.
</p>

<h3>Some curated links</h3>

<p><a href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki">fossil vs. git</a>,
a useful primer for understanding fossil from a git
perspecitve. Brings up the classic "Cathedral vs Bazaar"
metaphor in a way I never thought about before.
</p>
<p>Some technical reference for the <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fileformat.wiki#wikichng">fossil file format</a>.
Useful for me because I want to build tools 
that <a href="/wiki/convergence">easily talk to eachother.</a></p>
