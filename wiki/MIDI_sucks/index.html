<title>MIDI Sucks</title>
<h1>MIDI Sucks</h1>
<p>MIDI sucks. This isn't just an opinion, it is a philosophy.
It's a decades-old format that has not aged well in many
regards. If you are making computer music, I promise more
interesting things will happens if you avoid using MIDI.
</p>

<h2>Keyboard Centric</h2>

<p>The MIDI standard was built by keyboardists, for
keyboardists. As a result, it is very difficult to not
think/sound like a keyboardist while using MIDI. Two very
keyboard-y things include polyphony, and blocky chord
progressions.
</p>
<p>In the computer music world, neither of these are all that
interesting to explore.
</p>
<p>In other words, using MIDI will force you to think about
music in a specific way.
</p>

<h2>Low Resolution</h2>

<p>Traditional MIDI is a low-resolution standard. Continuous
control is 7-bit, or 128 steps. This can cause an unwanted
zipper effect for parameter control. As a result, most
synthesizers must employ smoothing to compensenate for this.
Smoothing filters introduce a syrupy kind of latency which
dulls responsiveness.
</p>
<p>With a bit of effort, 14-bit control can be done using pitch
the bend parameter. 14-bits is quite decent, but it's a
hack on the standard.
</p>
<p>The MIDI file format has low temporal resolution. It uses
a metric known as pulses-per-quarternote or PPQ. A good
typical setting for this is 96.
</p>

<h2>Complexity</h2>

<p>For how it is used in a modern context, MIDI is a
monstrously complex standard, full of legacy cruft that is
unused today. For instance, when was the last time a synth
properly used polyphonic aftertouch channel voice message?
</p>

<h2>Compositional Laziness</h2>

<p>MIDI makes it too easy for composers to write medicore
sounding music. If you've ever heard music that
"sounds like MIDI" this is what I mean. This is usually
due to a mixture of things. Many composers will generate a
MIDI file and use general MIDI soundfonts, which tend
to sound cheap and dated. Poorly sequenced MIDI that is
keyed in rather than performed often will sound repetitive
and fatiguing. This is because it is easy to forget to add
humanization and nuance.
</p>
<p>MIDI is well suited to think about music in terms
of events, notes, and sequences. When composing with MIDI,
it is very easy to just get sucked into getting those things
right. Continuous events like phrasing and shaping can often
get forgotten, and these are crucial to making expressive
and compelling performances.
