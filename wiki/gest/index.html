<title>Gest</title>
<h1>Gest</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Gest may someday be a tool for creating musical sound
gestures that can be synchronized with
an external clock source. It aims to be part sequencer,
part line generator.
</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p><blockquote>
<b>2021-05-29 11:46:12</b>: I haven't figured out a convenient way to notate these gestures. Some sort of DSL probably. That's going to require some thought.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:44:51</b>: these ramps would then be used as variables in sequencing generators for various interpolation methods to get from point A to point B.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:43:24</b>: I have been basically imagining gestures being constructed out of a hierarchy of ramp signals generated from a phasor clock source. N number of phasor periods makes a single base ramp, which can be further subdivided into smaller ramps, which can be further subdivided, and so on.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:39:58</b>: well, not arbitrary precision. it's floating point. but for rhythmic subdivision in music with room for microtimings, it's practically abritrary precision.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:38:12</b>: phasors are pretty awesome because they contain continuous time data. It's pretty trivial to subdivide a phasor, and even scale it too. It's also very easy to turn phasors into clock signals with arbitrary precision.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:34:55</b>: I was stuck for a while thinking how one could synchronize line generators with clock signals. Then I realized you could have a clock signal be a phasor instead of a tick signal like metro.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:31:59</b>: it has been several months since I updated this page, but I've been thinking about this project off and on.
