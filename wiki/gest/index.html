<h1>Gest</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Gest (pronounced "jest") aims to someday be a sequencer for
gestures. Conceptually, lies somewhere in between a classic
step sequencer and an automation curve editor.
</p>
<p>Timing in Gest is controlled via an external clock signal,
referred to as the <code>conductor</code> signal. The conductor signal
is expected to be a <code>phasor</code>: a periodic rising ramp signal
in range 0 and 1. Each period is considered as a musical
beat in time.
</p>
<p>Once instantiated with a conductor signal, Gest can then
be configured to produce <code>gestures</code>: audio-rate continuous
control signals intended to modulate synthesis parameters
(such as the frequency of an oscillator, or the cutoff of a
filter). Gestures are chunked into groups known as
<code>phrases</code>, which are blocked out to be a fixed duration
in units of beats.
</p>
<p>A phrase, once created, will analyze the conductor signal
and resynthesize a new slower signal by a factor of N beats,
where N is the duration of the phrase. This will produce a
single ramp from 0 to 1 that extends the duration of the
phrase. This particular operation is known as a <code>monoramp</code>.
This monoramp acts as a blank canvas for the phrase, and
can be equally divided up into an arbitrary number of
smaller ramps. This operation produces a <code>polyramp</code>.
Contiguous ramp segments in a polyramp can be merged
together into monoramps, and then divided into new
polyramps. This process produces a tree of ramps, known
as a <code>ramptree</code>.
</p>
<p>Every leaf node of a ramptree gets appended with a discrete
scalar value known as a <code>target</code>. Using the normalized
continuous values from the ramp tree, targets can be
interpolated together to produce line segments. The way
which a target gets to the next target is known as a
<code>behavior</code>.
</p>
<p>A behavior can be any function that takes in an alpha value,
and produce an output that involves two values A and B. It
is typically assumed that behaviors try to be contiguous:
when alpha is 0, the output should A. When alpha is 1, the
output should be B.
</p>
<p>Some examples of behaviors can include: linear, exponential,
step, and smoothstep.

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p><blockquote>
<b>2021-06-24 09:25:31</b>: gave the (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) page an initial overview. it's a pretty good distillation of the concepts I have so far.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:46:12</b>: I haven't figured out a convenient way to notate these gestures. Some sort of DSL probably. That's going to require some thought.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:44:51</b>: these ramps would then be used as variables in sequencing generators for various interpolation methods to get from point A to point B.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:43:24</b>: I have been basically imagining gestures being constructed out of a hierarchy of ramp signals generated from a phasor clock source. N number of phasor periods makes a single base ramp, which can be further subdivided into smaller ramps, which can be further subdivided, and so on.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:39:58</b>: well, not arbitrary precision. it's floating point. but for rhythmic subdivision in music with room for microtimings, it's practically abritrary precision.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:38:12</b>: phasors are pretty awesome because they contain continuous time data. It's pretty trivial to subdivide a phasor, and even scale it too. It's also very easy to turn phasors into clock signals with arbitrary precision.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:34:55</b>: I was stuck for a while thinking how one could synchronize line generators with clock signals. Then I realized you could have a clock signal be a phasor instead of a tick signal like metro.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-29 11:31:59</b>: it has been several months since I updated this page, but I've been thinking about this project off and on.
