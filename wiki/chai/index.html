<title>A Chai Recipe</title>
<h1>A Chai Recipe</h1>

<h3>Introduction (blah blah blah)</h3>

<p>This is approximately the recipe I use to make Chai for
myself. Evolved through trial and error. This particular one
was made fall 2018.
</p>
<p>The original goal was to make something approximating
thai iced tea, but this works well as a general chai,
hot or cold.
</p>
<p>I <b>do</b> boil the tea. If this triggers you, turn back now.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p>3 star anise pods
</p>
<p>10 cardamom pods
</p>
<p>1 cinnamon stick
</p>
<p>1/4 cups black loose leaf tea (I used something called
Kenilworth)
</p>
<p>2 quarts water
</p>
<p>2/3 cup sugar
</p>
<p>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
</p>
<p>1 tablespoon pure almond extract
</p>
<p>Milk and/or half and half
</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>Place tea, star anise, cardamon, and cinnamon stick into
a infuser.
</p>
<p>Place water and sugar into a saucepan and bring to a boil
on a stove, allowing the sugar to dissolve completely. Then
place the infuser in the tea.
</p>
<p>With the infuser still inside, boil off the tea for about 15
minutes. Add in vanill and almond extract. Transfer to a
smaller saucepan if a good chunk has boiled off.
</p>
<p>Continue boiling off tea for another 15-30 minutes to taste.
The goal is to boil off 40-50% of the tea. The idea is to
condense things into a very strong flavor.
</p>
<p>This tea is intended to be served with liberal amounts of
milk and cream. The flavor of the dairy combined with the
sugar offsets the bitterness in the strong tea and brings
out the wanted flavors.</p>
