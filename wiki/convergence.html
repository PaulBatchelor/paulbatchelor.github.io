<title>Convergence</title>
<h1>Convergence</h1>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<b>Convergence</b> refers to state inside of a
creative software ecosystem where all software works
simultaneously to create a single thing.

<h2>Example</h2>

In my creative software ecosystem, all my tools converge
around SQLite.
<br>
Computer music is composed using runt/scheme via Monolith.
Monolith saves presets and state data to SQlite. This is
the first point of convergence.
<br>
runt/scheme code made in monolith can be written as a
literate program via org. For scheme code blocks can
be evaluated in realtime via org-babel. Worgle can save
data to a SQLite file. This is the second point of
convergence.
<br>
SQLar is a utility that stores files inside of a SQLite
data as an archive. The third point of convergence.
<br>
Fossil is a source code versioning system. It saves
data to a SQLite database. This is the fourth point of
convergence.
<br>
WeeWiki saves content to a SQLite databse. The fifth point
of convergence.
<br>
With data all stored in a single database, there is great
potential for crosstalk. This could most likely happen
inside of WeeWiki, due to the scripting environment made.
