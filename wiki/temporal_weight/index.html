<title>Temporal Weight</title>
<h1>Temporal Weight</h1>
<p>Eventually, this will outline the concept the temporal
weight.
</p>
<p>For now, here are some words based on a comment I made
on the <a href="llllllll.co">lines forum</a>:
</p>
<p><code>Temporal Weight</code> offers a different way to
think about tempo control in a sequenced work.
</p>
<p>Most DAWs manage tempo with some sort of global tempo
control that is managed with automation curve. Drop any
notes into slow regions, they ll be be slower. Drop any
notes into faster regions, they ll be faster.
</p>
<p>Temporal weight reverses the relationship of notes and
global tempo. The main idea is that each note has mass
which bends and fluctuates the relative tempo around it. A
note with more temporal mass will warp the tempo and make
it faster. A note with negative temporal mass will make it
slower. Masses are not in units of BPM, it s all a relative
scale that can get adjusted elsewhere. I also made it so a
note can control the inertia, or how quickly the tempo
responds to changes from the notes.
</p>
<p>This approach can be very useful when sequencing
lyrical pieces of music that have a lot of tempo
stretching/compression in it. Working out the weights of
each notes requires thinking about the overall musical
phrasing. What is cool here is that this approach can be
more one than one valid interpretation this way. Once the
weights are in, the tempo curve gets generated implicitly.</p>
