<title>Fudge</title>
<h1>Fudge</h1>
<p>How to make old fashioned fudge. With commentary based
on <a href="/wiki/fudgelog">my own attempts</a>.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This recipe is based off the old Hershey recipe for old
fashioned fudge. It consists of an ingredient list and
a very short paragraph.
If you follow that recipe correctly,
you will get your fudge. However, I attempted this
recipe more than <a href="/wiki/fudgelog">no less than half a dozen times</a>, and found it was
easy to screw up. This recipe will elaborate on the Hershey,
and provide some insights into what makes a good batch of
fudge.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>Here are the ingredients and their quantities:
</p>
<p>3 cups white granulated sugar
</p>
<p>2/3 cups cocoa powder
</p>
<p>1 1/2 cups milk
</p>
<p>1/8 tsp salt
</p>
<p>4 tbs (1/2 stick) butter (unmelted)
</p>
<p>1 tsp vanilla extract
</p>
<p>Fudge made the "old fashioned" way is a made up of simple
ingredients. Sugar and milk with a 2:1 ratio, cocoa powder,
butter, with vanilla and a pinch of salt for flavor.
</p>
<p>Newer recipes will often call for additional
things like corn syrup and sweetened condensed milk. These
particular ingredients help to make the outcome a little
more "foolproof" in the end result. With a traditional
recipe only using sugar, you're working with a much smaller
margin for error.
</p>
<p>Highly recommended: a precise thermometer. I've used digital
thermometers, but a good candy thermometer is best. With
traditional fudge, it's very important to nail the soft ball
stage.
</p>
<p>If you're paranoid about your thermometer (I am/was, I have
multiple thermometers), you can take the temperature of
boiling water. A well calibrated thermometer should read
100C. My candy thermometer is analogue, and actually has a
nut you can adjust to calibrate it.
</p>
<p>Highly recommended: an electric mixer for beating fudge.
You'll get more consistent, more reliable results this way.
Also, it's less work.
</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>In a large sauce pan (4 qts or so) mix the dry ingredients
together: sugar, cocoa powder, salt. Make sure they are well
blended.
</p>
<p>Mix in the milk, and stir <b>without</b> heat until evenly mixed
in.
</p>
<p>Turn the heat on to about medium, to medium high. Gently and
slowly stir until it starts to reach a boil.
</p>
<p>Once it reaches a boil, <b>stop stirring</b>, and turn the heat
to medium low. If you stir while it boils, you risk the
chance of the sugar (over?)crystalizing, and you get
graininess. Setting to low heat is important. You want the
mixture to heat up nice and evenly.
</p>
<p>You'll want to drop in your candy thermometer at this point.
Keep the heat on medium-low, and wait for the temperature to
reach the softball stage. You'll get slightly different
answers at the range for softball, the general consensus is
about 234F-239F. The lower end (~234F) is ideal for fudge.
If you go higher than 239, you start to enter in hardball
stage and things will start to resemble the consistency of
taffy, or worse. (If this happens, don't worry! you can
salvage your fudge no problem. I'll explain more on this
later).
</p>
<p>Once the fudge reaches ~234 (softball), turn the heat off
and immediately transfer to another bowl (I use a kitchenaid
mixer to beat the fudge, so I put it in there), and add
the vanilla and butter. The butter should be at around room
temperature and <b>NOT</b> melted (melted butter could warp the
precise softball-stage fudge). Do <b>NOT</b> scrape the edges of
the saucepan into the new bowl when transferring, as stuff
on the edges can get too hot and introduce sugar crystals
that can give fudge texture an undesirable graininess. This
is mostly why transferring is done in the first place.
</p>
<p>In the new bowl, allow fudge mix to cool to about 110F-114F.
If you don't wait long enough, you could risk introducing
more grainy textures.
</p>
<p>When cooled to about ~110F, it is time to beat the fudge, or
vigorously stir it. Many recipes say to do this until the
fudge "loses it's gloss", but honestly I have no idea
what that looks like. There should be a noticeable
consistency change though: the fudge mix will get thicker.
If you're mixing by hand, it will get increasingly more
difficult to work.
</p>
<p>With my kitchen aid mixer, I use a fairly low setting with
the paddle for about 5 minutes (I do use a timer for this).
When I've stirred it by hand, I do anywhere from 6-10
minutes. (I have not had as much luck doing it by hand doing
it by hand though). In my experience, the consistency of good
fudge can range from being very easy to pour, to being
lightly malleable. It is possible to overbeat fudge.
Overbeating will cause fudge to get too hard.
</p>
<p>After you've beaten the fudge, pour/scrape in a greased
glass pan big enough so that it's about 1/2 to 3/4 inches
thick. Place pan in fridge for 1-4 hours to let it set.
Going into the fridge, the fudge will probably look goopy
and sticky and disappointing. That's okay!
</p>
<p>If done right, the fudge will cool down and have a very
nice matte finish to it. At that point, you can cut it into
squares. You now have fudge. Hopefully.
</p>

<h2>How to Reset Fudge</h2>

<p>If you mess up the fudge somehow (and I have, many times),
it is usually possible to salvage this fudge by "resetting"
it.
</p>
<p>To reset fudge, put as much of the fudge as you can into
your sauce pan and add about 1 cup water. Stir and bring
to a boil, stop stirring, and then let it reach softball
stage again like before. From there, you let it cool
properly, beat it, and then put in a pan again to let it
set.
