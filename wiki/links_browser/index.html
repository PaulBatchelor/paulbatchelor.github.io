<h1>Links Web Browser</h1>
<p><a href="http://links.twibright.com/">links</a> is a surprisingly capable
web-browser that is primarily text based.
</p>
<p>It's lightning fast, and can be compiled with graphics
support using x11 (including images). For most basic HTML
(such as the kind found on this website), things look
surprisingly decent!
</p>
<p>When compiling from source, I use the following configure
flags:
</p>
<pre><code>./configure --x-includes=/usr/include --x-libraries=/usr/lib --enable-graphics --with-x --with-ssl</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Strangely enough, on Alpine, I need to explicitely state the
library and header locations for X.
</p>
<p>I do have a small patch for links that adds HJKL support and
a hard-coded white background by default, but it's a little
broken right now so I'm not going to share it.</p>
