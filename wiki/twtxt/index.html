<h1>TWTXT</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">twtxt</a> is a
simple decentralized microblogging platform.
tweets are written in a specially formatted timestamped
text file, which are then published online using some kind
of file server.
</p>
<p>Right now, I am using <a href="https://github.com/mdom/txtnish">txtnish</a> to interface with twtxt.
</p>

<p>Hello twtxt world
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>I could see me using this. Just need to figure out the best workflow for making 'tweets'.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>right now, it's a three step process for me to tweet and upload. gotta make it just one.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>trying out script. not instant upload, but that's probably for the best
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>the best vacations are the ones in your mind
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>Maybe it's just me getting older, but there is something very satisfying about seeing big chunky text on screen. Currently using an Atari font on my computer. Once your eyes get used to it, it's actually quite lovely.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>Tweeting from GPD pocket now
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>Tweeting from MBP now.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>testing out auto-generation of twtxt wiki page now
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>testing auto-publish
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>seeing if auto-publisher works out on other computer
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>gears seem to turn okay.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>statically generated my twtxt feed here: https://pbat.ch/wiki/twtxt.html. learning how to be social on this thing comes next.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>it is time to add a test suite for orgparse/weewiki.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>added paragraph blocks and code blocks to weewiki HTML output. things look decent.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>when composing, it can be hard to know what is good or crap, so you just have to power through it
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>rx pixel editor looks seen on HN today looks interesting to me (and the sort of thing I've wanted to build), but the vulkan support seems like overkill. Also, my graphics cards drivers are broken on Alpine, so the program probably won't run. trying anyways.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>lol build broke. see ya later rx.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>planck keyboard feels 98% natural to me now. I'm using stiff tactile grey cherry switches on them, which feel great to me, but my fingers need to build up strength for long-term use.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>postcard sized art is such a lovely scale for the visual medium. attempting to imagine the sound/temporal version of that
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>listening richard devine's new album sort/lave today. of course the sounds are top notch, but I really am enjoying how 'composed' it all feels. it really demonstrates true mastery of modular environments.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>even though I have these nice hs7 studio monitors on my desk right now, most of my monitoring has been done using my minirig mini. There is just something so irresistable about writing music for something so cute and tiny.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>should also note that I have been traveling a lot recently, so the heavy speakers do not travel with me. it is difficult to get re-acquainted with them for this reason.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>gameboy color speaker replaced using ds lite speaker. sounds quieter than I expected. but better than no sound at all. this, combined with the new case I got for it, makes it almost feel like a brand new device :)
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>after a month hiatus, I am getting back into some low level norns work. 8x8 bitmap fonts look real good on this thing
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>physical models are wild animals that are never meant to be domesticated
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>thank you sean costello for teaching me how to make planetarium music
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>finally hacked ijanet up to behave like the scheme REPL. very excited about this!
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>weewiki org parser is getting a little bit better. fun bits are long gone, and now it is just tedious bugfixing.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>embedded scripting languages are all fun and games until you break their garbage collector
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>that moment when the gbz80 tutorial tells you that mul and div operations do not exist...
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>Dreamed of mangos last night. So many mangos. Not sure why.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>mincer ported to patchwerk. missed ya buddy
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>the mind-numbing task of undoing bad C++
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>Can life be measured in bytes shaved off?
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>attempting to build arm-none-eabi cross compiler from source. why have I never thought of this?
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>It really looks so much better not having html extension in my wiki.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>so glad USB phone tethering exists. no way am I going to stumble through wpacli to connect to coffeeshop wifi
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>made a PR to the linux-surface kernel today. it's only udev rules, but I still feel accomplished
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>steam controller is a fascinating little thing
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>despite all the tools I've made, it is still a chore to update this thing. some things you just can't automate
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>dusting off the ol' arduboy
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>when did I dream of mangos. wut?
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>coss a toin to ur witchr
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>building a http server into weewiki has been more useful than I initially expected
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>made a script that simplifies making twtxt entries. let's see how well it works...
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>all I have to do is hit "say", write a few bits of things, and then hit ENTER. much easier than using txtnish directly.
</p>

<h5>nil</h5>

<p>my hope is that I'll be able integrate this more with my wiki somehow. I think they are a good pairing.
