<h1>Musigram</h1>
<p>An idea not to be <a href="/wiki/halfbaked">taken too seriously.</a>. Also, it's probably
not the most novel idea either.
</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the idea here is basically
"musical morse code". Encode data into a musical
melody that is human readable: that is to say,
a musician could transcribe the melody without exerting
too much effort.
</p>
<p>Information is broken up into musical beats. A musical beat
can up to 3 notes in it with a distinct rhythmic pattern: a
combination of Quarter (Q), Eighth (E), and Sixteenth Notes
(S), and Dotted Eigths (E.)
</p>
<p>We use these to obtain 7 rhythmic patterns:
</p>
<pre><code>Q, EE, E.S, SE., ESS, SES, SSE</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>4 sixteenth notes (SSSS) is omitted. It would end up
being too dense, and too annoying.
</p>
<p>Each of these notes can be mapped to a pitch in a scale.
1.5 octaves of a pentatonic scale gives 9 notes:
do re mi so la, do re mi so
</p>
<p>This scal chose because penatonic sounds pretty.
</p>
<p>With the 9 pitches and rhythms, you get a fair amount of
permutations: 1 one-note rhythm, 3 2-note rhythms, and 3
3-note rhythms:
</p>
<pre><code>9 + 3*9^2 + 3*9^3 = 2,439</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>...or log2(2439) bits of
information, or ~11.25 bits of information.
</p>
<p>This system therefore allows encoding 11-bits of information
a beat, or 5.5 bytes in a bar, or 88 bytes in a 16-bar
melody. There's also some unused bits remaining with this
approach. If one really wanted to pack the maximum amount
of information in 16 bars, you could squeeze in 90 bytes of
information in a 16-bar melody that in theory should be
easy for musicians to transcribe.
</p>
<p>This system could be modified too. More rhythmic patterns
such as the "ssss" pattern could be introduced. More pitches
could be added: a 1.5 octave major scale could have 12
pitches. Timbre was not considered here, but using things
like phonemes could add more resolution to the data. It
isn't terribly taxing to add 3 or 4 distinct vowel sounds.
</p>
<p>Using the more extreme end of this paradigm, how much
digital information could you cram in here?
</p>
<pre><code>12 pitches x 4 vowels = 48 pitch-vowel combinations</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>If we introduce the very dense sixteenth note pattern SSSS,
we get this many pitch/rhythm permutations:
</p>
<pre><code>48 + 3*48^2 + 3*48^3 + 48^4 = 5,647,152 permutations</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>In one beat of music, that is ~22 bits of
digital information. In 16 bars of 4/4 music, that's
1435 bytes of data, which I think is about the upper limit
of what you'd want in a human readable audio format for
representing data.
</p>
<p>To be continued...
