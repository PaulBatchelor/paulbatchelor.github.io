<h1>A recipe for literate programming</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Think about the program: the problem it solves, and the
structure.
</p>
<p>Go for a walk. Do the dishes. Watch some TV.
</p>
<p>Go back and think about the program.
</p>
<p>Think about it some more.
</p>
<p>Stop thinking about it again. Let your subconscious handle
it for a bit.
</p>
<p>Do you have an idea what structure of the program will be
like? Talk it over with yourself. Make you sure agree with
them.
</p>
<p>On second thought, nevermind. Think about it some more.
What problem does it really need to solve? How does it do
it? What is the structure and flow of the program?
</p>
<p>Mumble to yourself a bit more. That's it. Fully formed
complete sentences. Good. Time to write those articulate
mumbles down.
</p>
<p>Begin writing. Talk about the program. Write in 1-2
sentence chunks. Don't worry about order here. Aim for
self-contained nuggets.
</p>
<p>Keep writing until everything you know about the program is
written down.
</p>
<p>Edit. Move things around. Make it flow. Begin thinking about
what the code is going to look like. You're about to write
some code.
</p>
<p>You know what? The code can wait. Go back and look at your
writing. It should feel like a complete description of the
program. Is there anything missing? See any edge cases or
complications? Nows a good chance.
</p>
<p>Write some initial boiler plate code. The flow should on
average alternate between words and code. Use named code
blocks to bend the code structure to the natural language
structure.
</p>
<p>Stop thinking about the program and do something else for
a bit. I've heard good things about that new show on
Netflix.
</p>
<p>Get ready to write some more code. Skim through the words
you have written. Edit where needed. A literate program is
not just optional documentation, it is how the program is
consumed and understood.
</p>
<p>Take breaks. Review. Edit. Code. Repeat until the program is
fully realized.
