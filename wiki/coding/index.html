<h1>Coding</h1>
<p>Why are we teaching people "how to code"? "Coding" is the
term used by non-technical people to describe what software
engineers do. It is a misleading and harmful term that
should be discouraged. "Programming" is a term that is a
little bit better, as it envelopes other more important
aspects to developing software.
</p>
<p>To be precise, <b>coding</b> is the act of literally writing out
computer code to be read by the a computer and turned
into a program. By itself, actual coding is the easiest
part of a programmers job in just about every metric. The
syntax for any given language is usually quite straight
forward (not like a natural language), and the physical act
of typing code is usually not all that challenging either
(it's not that impressive in the 21st century to have a
decent typing speed).
</p>
<p>Much more time and effort is put into the thought process
leading up to the lines of code. If things are planned well
enough, code for a particular algorithm or program will fall
out naturally. Even more time and effort is put into
fixing already written code because it wasn't thought out
well enough in the first place.
</p>
<p>Coding by itself is a low-effort skill. Anyone can learn the
basic syntax of any modern programming language quite
easily. It's not a very valuable or meaningful skill to
learn. In fact, placing an emphasis on coding can actually
create bad programming habits.
</p>
<p>And while I'm at it, can we all agree that "code" has
terrible connotations in the English language? The term
"code" implies something that is cryptic and mysterious.
Something that takes effort to read and understand. Calling
code makes it sound like these attributes are desirable, and
nothing could be further from the truth. What we refer to as
"code" is really a sort of human-readable notation system
for computational structures. This notation is read by a
computer, which in turn gets converted into machine code
(and yes, now it is code).</p>
