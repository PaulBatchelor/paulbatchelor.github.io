<h1>Arduboy</h1>
<p>The Arduboy is a arduino-compatible portable game console.

<h3>Carduboy</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/carduboy">Carduboy</a> is a
bloat-free de-implementation of the
<a href="https://www.github.com/MLXXXp/Arduboy2">Arduboy2 Library.</a></p>
<p>It is written in C99 C, with extracted bits from
the Arduino Library. All that should be needed is
Make, avr-gcc, avr-libc, and avrdude.
Those who are familiar with Makefiles and C,
should feel quite comfortable using carduboy.
</p>
<p>In addition to being much simpler to use, the build
time should be much faster.
</p>
<p>Truth be told, I wrote this to avoid using the Arduino
IDE. It feels bloated and sluggish, and does not work
well on tiled window managers or Alpine Linux. Also,
it's written in Java? Blech. No thanks.
</p>
<p>I could have just stopped with making what was essentially
just a commandline version of the Arduino IDE, but then
I started peeling back some of the Arduboy2 layers and
started noticing a bunch of things I didn't need like the
boot screen. At that point, I decided to just start removing
code. I kept on removing code until all the C++ code
turned into C code!
</p>

<h3>TODO Games</h3>

<p>Someday I hope.
</p>

<h3>TODO Music + Arduboy</h3>

<p>A pipe dream of mine is to build an Arduboy and use it
to control a synthesizer (perhaps via interfacing
with another chip with a DAC?). It would be like
@(ref "norns")@, but closer to the metal.</p>
