<h1>Hyper-typewriter</h1>
<p>A <code>hypertypewriter</code>, or <code>hyper-typewriter</code>, is any digital
interface that mimics the affordances of a classic
<code>typewriter</code>.
</p>
<p>What we consider to be a <code>text editor</code> is usually some
form of hypertypewriter. Emacs, vim, nano, etc, are all
hypertypewriters.
</p>
<p>The hypertypewriter is only a description of the
interface. This interface need not be geared towards
editing or manipulating text. What would that look like?
</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the kind of software formerly referred to
as a "text editor" need not be limited to a
hypertypewriter interface. Anything that can manipulate text
is, in a way, a form of "text editor".</p>
