<h1>Create</h1>
<p>Yet another <a href="/wiki/metapages">meta-page</a>, tracking
messages from the <code>@create</code> group in this wiki's
<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>.
</p>
<p><blockquote>
<b>2021-07-14 22:25:33</b>: some initial work on temporal weights in (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>). It's starting to tap into some (<a href="/wiki/howyousay">howyousay</a>) energy. I already got my example working with two interpretations on how to shape the tempo flucations.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-13 11:29:36</b>: things really are coming along with \!gest today. hardly musical, but a start.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-09 20:18:54</b>: hoping to spend this weekend working on (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>). there's a lot to think about. words and some code have been written already these past two days.
</p>
<p><b>2021-06-24 09:40:32</b>: SDFs are pretty neat. I've been very intrigued by 2d SDFs, and how they can be used to describe very organic forms. I really want to build anthropomorphic things like faces/mouths and make them sing/talk/blink/stare.
</p>
<p><b>2021-06-24 09:25:31</b>: gave the (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) page an initial overview. it's a pretty good distillation of the concepts I have so far.
</p>
<p><b>2021-06-19 10:59:51</b>: I made a singing thing for #android called (<a href="/wiki/vocshape">vocshape</a>). I don't plan on doing much more with it.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-25 15:00:35</b>: something I've been musing over today is the notion of 'overpowered toys'. toys that have no right being as useful as they are. maybe this is just tools with whimsical branding?
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-24 21:15:09</b>: it's important that you <b>know</b> you are going in the right direction. most of the time, nobody is going to be there to cheer you on or validate your ideas.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-10 11:08:37</b>: I really hate when I have to break my previous works for stupid reasons. People suck.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-10 11:07:05</b>: crap. it looks like some of my (<a href="/wiki/breathing_cards">breathing_cards</a>) are broken again. xxyq is unusually noisy, and wanaijys needs a missing ugen.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-22 09:32:17</b>: it's been a minute (<a href="/wiki/breathing_cards">breathing_cards</a>). you too, (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-17 10:47:14</b>: some good initial progress on getting android dev environment for building <a href="#">toys</a>. Some notes taken in (<a href="/wiki/android_dev">android_dev</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 10:06:58</b>: I need to make android apps again. Publically this time. They were so much fun for me.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-15 09:06:45</b>: decided to publish some the initial words and ideas for my granular delay line I came up with a few months ago. No code yet, but I think it's a solid start. <a href="/loom/bugz">bugz</a>. My hope is to make it a part of (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>) as well.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-09 16:55:56</b>: added an ignore group option to the (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) shuffle functionality. My hope is to use it with (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) items to randomly choose samples in a collection that I haven't heard before. It adds a few noticeable milliseconds when it is used, but it is totally worth it!
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-09 13:14:18</b>: getting the hang of managing external harddrives in a workflow. All this time and I just avoided the problem by not using samples and synthesizing everything.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 17:24:25</b>: really anything that ends up being a song or picture in the end usually ends up being a satisfying investment of time.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 17:18:13</b>: this (<a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a>) project is very satisfying to code up. it's got a very nice bottoms-up structure to it that feels very clean. I love systems composed using only a handful of simple operations.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 11:47:38</b>: Apparently, this seems to be my workflow when writing creative software in a <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate style</a>: Dreams/Thoughts->Audible Rambling->Doodles->Structures->Words->Code.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-31 11:30:09</b>: a new breathing card created today: bc12.tizhaimy. one of the first to use wavetables loaded from disk (via the (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) interface).
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-23 10:05:59</b>: I usually try to avoid looking backwards at old work because it prevents me from moving forward (something I enjoy a great deal more). In this case, I it is too tempting to resist.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-23 10:04:37</b>: reproducing some of my old sporth sketches in (<a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>) today. At the (<a href="/wiki/runt">runt</a>) level, they are nearly identical with a few careful tweaks.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-22 11:33:57</b>: I'll also need to make public my sample curation platform too if anyone is going to attempt to try and run it.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-22 11:32:24</b>: a morning spent playing around with 3 random wavetables from the #akwf collection, and trying to do something with it. I've added the results to my #frags collection. It's private for now, but I might open source it? it's messy, but I like being transparent for whatever reason.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-20 17:26:42</b>: picking a sample at random from a library is a totally valid approach to sample curation. So, I added a shuffle feature to the (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) which picks N random elements that match a pattern. This general thing can then be used with (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) to choose random samples from a folder.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-20 10:38:35</b>: at some point, I want to write down my thoughts and notes for creating the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>). but it feels too soon right now.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 10:23:04</b>: some good stuff is happening with the weewiki zet page wrt sample curation. will have to update the (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>) page soon.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 10:50:50</b>: finally got around to jumping back into the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>). I was distracted doing this crate and zet stuff in (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 10:49:10</b>: Created a new group today called @create. Anything to do with creation or creating goes here. Software development is excluded here. #hello
