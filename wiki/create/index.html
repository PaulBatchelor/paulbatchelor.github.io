<p>Yet another <a href="/wiki/metapages">meta-page</a>, tracking
messages from the <code>@create</code> group in this wiki's
<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>.

<p><blockquote>
<b>2021-01-06 11:47:38</b>: Apparently, this seems to be my workflow when writing creative software in a <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate style</a>: Dreams/Thoughts->Audible Rambling->Doodles->Structures->Words->Code.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-31 11:30:09</b>: a new breathing card created today: bc12.tizhaimy. one of the first to use wavetables loaded from disk (via the (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) interface).
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-23 10:05:59</b>: I usually try to avoid looking backwards at old work because it prevents me from moving forward (something I enjoy a great deal more). In this case, I it is too tempting to resist.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-23 10:04:37</b>: reproducing some of my old sporth sketches in (<a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>) today. At the (<a href="/wiki/runt">runt</a>) level, they are nearly identical with a few careful tweaks.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-22 11:33:57</b>: I'll also need to make public my sample curation platform too if anyone is going to attempt to try and run it.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-22 11:32:24</b>: a morning spent playing around with 3 random wavetables from the #akwf collection, and trying to do something with it. I've added the results to my #frags collection. It's private for now, but I might open source it? it's messy, but I like being transparent for whatever reason.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-20 17:26:42</b>: picking a sample at random from a library is a totally valid approach to sample curation. So, I added a shuffle feature to the (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) which picks N random elements that match a pattern. This general thing can then be used with (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) to choose random samples from a folder.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-20 10:38:35</b>: at some point, I want to write down my thoughts and notes for creating the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>). but it feels too soon right now.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 10:23:04</b>: some good stuff is happening with the weewiki zet page wrt sample curation. will have to update the (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>) page soon.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 10:50:50</b>: finally got around to jumping back into the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>). I was distracted doing this crate and zet stuff in (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 10:49:10</b>: Created a new group today called @create. Anything to do with creation or creating goes here. Software development is excluded here. #hello
