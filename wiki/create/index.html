<blockquote>
<p><b>2022-03-28 09:54:32</b>: updates to (<a href="/wiki/gesture">gesture</a>) page. trying to solidify the concepts I'm working on.
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-14 09:40:29</b>: got around to making a (<a href="/wiki/mnolth">mnolth</a>) wiki page
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-08 21:39:47</b>: been thinking about this concept for a game where your character is a melting ice cube and the object of the game is to explore as much of the world as possible before melting entirely.
</p>
<p><b>2022-02-25 12:14:21</b>: got around to making a wiki page for (<a href="/wiki/uxnseq">uxnseq</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2022-01-30 21:00:50</b>: Actually, two things I still need to do: randomness in Uxn (for picking out random sequences), and systems for coordination (if sequence A does this, sequence B should be doing this). If I can do this, I can make some very sophisticated generative systems for singing synthesizers.
</p>
<p><b>2022-01-30 20:57:18</b>: this is only the beginning. the big I am working up towards is making a version of (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) that is managed via an instance of Uxn. With this and the autosync logic in <a href="/sndkit/rephasor">rephasor</a>, I think I have all the ingredients now to make this happen.
</p>
<p><b>2022-01-30 20:54:40</b>: lots of work done today in my experiments using the Uxn VM to control a sequencer inside of (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2022-01-26 18:26:57</b>: sequencing with (<a href="/wiki/gesture">gesture</a>) today. some very promising results so far.
</p>
<p><b>2022-01-11 11:25:11</b>: (<a href="/wiki/bitlets">bitlets</a>) etude 3 with explanation <a href="/wiki/bitlets#part3">part3</a>.
</p>
<p><b>2022-01-08 13:11:24</b>: I now have a wiki page for (<a href="/wiki/bitlets">bitlets</a>). For now these are my liner notes. Hoping to have more information and context eventually. Not sure where I want to host the videos yet.
</p>
<p><b>2022-01-03 11:20:03</b>: bitrune project behind the scenes: added up to 16 pages of glyphs to type out. should be enough room to notate out little programs.
</p>
<p><b>2022-01-02 21:19:23</b>: have a concept to start a new etude series called bitlets. a collection of small little pieces written using a bitmaptic glyph system that gets incrementally developed. It'll be a symbolic language that will use a thing called bitrune. bitrunes->lua->LIL->sndkit
</p>
<p><b>2021-12-25 12:03:19</b>: some good initial work implementing a prototype parser for bitpatterns that could be drawn on a monome (<a href="/wiki/grid">grid</a>). There is a lookup dictionary that allows symbols to be associated with C functions and pointers.
</p>
<p><b>2021-11-14 07:19:40</b>: thinking about the notion of a (<a href="/wiki/hypertypewriter">hypertypewriter</a>), especially how it can used to make sound in a so-called "live coding" scenario.
</p>
<p><b>2021-11-10 10:45:45</b>: (<a href="/wiki/sqlar">sqlar</a>) and sqlarfs have been pretty convenient in my (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>) workflow efforts. The idea of everything belong to one centralized thing is very grounding from a creative point of view.
</p>
<p><b>2021-11-09 22:05:55</b>: noticing that my (<a href="/wiki/novembeat_2021">novembeat_2021</a>) creations are still very loop-based, similar to (<a href="/wiki/looptober_2021">looptober_2021</a>). I guess right now I'm just happy to be coming up with ideas every day. Developing said ideas can come next.
</p>
<p><b>2021-11-09 14:01:26</b>: I am putting more effort into (<a href="/wiki/musigram">musigram</a>) than I care to admit.
</p>
<p><b>2021-11-09 13:56:49</b>: holy cow my personal (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) for (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>) is starting to resemble usefulnes!
</p>
<p><b>2021-11-07 16:40:02</b>: dutifully taking notes for (<a href="/wiki/novembeat_2021">novembeat_2021</a>)
</p>
<p><b>2021-11-04 09:44:30</b>: slowly getting the hang of using (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) and (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) to do (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>). It is definitely a discipline that must be practiced.
</p>
<p><b>2021-10-30 19:34:20</b>: almost done with #looptober. one loop a day, using only #vocalsynthesis via <a href="/sndkit/tract">tract</a> and <a href="/sndkit/glottis">glottis</a>, and sequencing done with <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>. It has been an exhausting experience, but also a helpful one.
</p>
<p><b>2021-10-25 13:13:45</b>: I'm just about to reset my (<a href="/wiki/now">now</a>) page, but there's a bit about animism that I want to preserve in my zettelkasten. I think it's a nifty concept: every device you own has a little spirit waiting to be awoken by the right program written for them. This thought process makes software feel more tangible and tethered to hardware. A mindset worth cultivating in the collapse to come?
</p>
<p><b>2021-10-13 11:18:42</b>: I have started a page outlining all the code I have written for #looptober: (<a href="/wiki/looptober_2021">looptober_2021</a>)
</p>
<p><b>2021-10-02 18:39:07</b>: just added <a href="/sndkit/sparse">sparse</a> to sndkit, really so I could get something approximating vinyl noise. I'm interested in making a loop for #looptober in the style of distintigration loops.
</p>
<p><b>2021-09-16 10:04:21</b>: scalars implemented in (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) today, which required creating a thing called target actions. all this for gate signals, because I realized that for melodic sequencing, I wanted rests and silence. should be helpful for my #synthwavefromscratch project.
</p>
<p><b>2021-09-05 12:19:05</b>: metatargets implemented in (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) today! I also created a nice little example that shifts between targets with varying weights, naturally warping the tempo of the sequence. A very chopin-y kind of compression and expansion of tempo, with very little notation required to get there.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-31 21:05:22</b>: one of the more interesting things in (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) are the use of behaviors, which dictate how two targets interpolate between one another. there's a lot of fertile ground for exploration here. lots of (<a href="/wiki/howyousay">howyousay</a>) energy.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-31 18:07:18</b>: on a 2-day streak synthesizing vocal ensembles. I do not think it will continue. Today I sequenced a small 4-part melody riff using jazz harmony. Straight-ahead rhythm instead of swung, which makes it sound a little odd. Maybe even creepy. But it's a neat vibe. I made it a loop and that's it for now.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-31 13:15:13</b>: word vomit on (<a href="/wiki/gesture">gesture</a>) today. needs more work.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-29 22:14:49</b>: it looks like I'm really going to overdo it with the glissando for a while until I get used to gestures in (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>). that stuff sounds so cool haha.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-29 11:21:10</b>: attempting to sequence a melody I wrote out last night using (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) and performed with (<a href="#">tract</a>). Hoping to add 3-4 part harmony to it. What'll be neat is I'll be using the computer to explore the voice leading, rather than my brain + piano.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-23 20:54:47</b>: some initial pages on some concepts I've been developing: (<a href="/wiki/gesture">gesture</a>) and (<a href="/wiki/temporal_weight">temporal_weight</a>). more words to come soon hopefully.
</p>
<p><b>2021-08-22 14:59:50</b>: In scheming my next breathing card, I found myself wanting to be able to convert clocks into phasors to do frame-accurate video stuff and use (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>). I've put this off for a while because there's no great way to do it, but I think <a href="/sndkit/clkphs">clkphs</a> is about as good as it can get. Now I need to adjust gest to ignore negative conductor signal values and I should be good to go!
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-21 20:28:44</b>: much debugging today in (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>), and what do I have to show for it? a melody that is a ripoff of rite of spring, being performed on a flat FM oscillator. baby steps in the right direction...
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-20 21:21:05</b>: gotta start digging into the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>). (<a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a>) isn't ready, but there is lots of sound to be explored with (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-20 21:02:59</b>: ah. I sorta promised I wouldn't do it because (<a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">toys_not_tools</a>), but I went and added exponential and bezier behavior to (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>). Now it does basically everything (<a href="/wiki/libline">libline</a>) set out to do, but better. Goodbye libline, you were mighty in purpose and potential, but deeply flawed.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-19 10:47:51</b>: I don't have a great way of saying this yet, but I've always made a hard wedge between interactive and non-interactive music (such as a WAV file). however, WAV files <b>are</b> interactive, to a certain extend. You hit play/pause, and you can move the playhead sometimes. It's not great interaction, but it's not not interaction right?
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-15 09:22:36</b>: just merged all my test gestures together into one medley in (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) and it is quite satisfying.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-14 22:25:33</b>: some initial work on temporal weights in (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>). It's starting to tap into some (<a href="/wiki/howyousay">howyousay</a>) energy. I already got my example working with two interpretations on how to shape the tempo flucations.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-13 11:29:36</b>: things really are coming along with \!gest today. hardly musical, but a start.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-09 20:18:54</b>: hoping to spend this weekend working on (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>). there's a lot to think about. words and some code have been written already these past two days.
</p>
<p><b>2021-06-24 09:40:32</b>: SDFs are pretty neat. I've been very intrigued by 2d SDFs, and how they can be used to describe very organic forms. I really want to build anthropomorphic things like faces/mouths and make them sing/talk/blink/stare.
</p>
<p><b>2021-06-24 09:25:31</b>: gave the (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) page an initial overview. it's a pretty good distillation of the concepts I have so far.
</p>
<p><b>2021-06-19 10:59:51</b>: I made a singing thing for #android called (<a href="/wiki/vocshape">vocshape</a>). I don't plan on doing much more with it.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-25 15:00:35</b>: something I've been musing over today is the notion of 'overpowered toys'. toys that have no right being as useful as they are. maybe this is just tools with whimsical branding?
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-24 21:15:09</b>: it's important that you <b>know</b> you are going in the right direction. most of the time, nobody is going to be there to cheer you on or validate your ideas.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-10 11:08:37</b>: I really hate when I have to break my previous works for stupid reasons. People suck.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-10 11:07:05</b>: crap. it looks like some of my (<a href="/wiki/breathing_cards">breathing_cards</a>) are broken again. xxyq is unusually noisy, and wanaijys needs a missing ugen.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-22 09:32:17</b>: it's been a minute (<a href="/wiki/breathing_cards">breathing_cards</a>). you too, (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-17 10:47:14</b>: some good initial progress on getting android dev environment for building <a href="#">toys</a>. Some notes taken in (<a href="/wiki/android_dev">android_dev</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 10:06:58</b>: I need to make android apps again. Publically this time. They were so much fun for me.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-15 09:06:45</b>: decided to publish some the initial words and ideas for my granular delay line I came up with a few months ago. No code yet, but I think it's a solid start. <a href="/loom/bugz">bugz</a>. My hope is to make it a part of (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>) as well.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-09 16:55:56</b>: added an ignore group option to the (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) shuffle functionality. My hope is to use it with (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) items to randomly choose samples in a collection that I haven't heard before. It adds a few noticeable milliseconds when it is used, but it is totally worth it!
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-09 13:14:18</b>: getting the hang of managing external harddrives in a workflow. All this time and I just avoided the problem by not using samples and synthesizing everything.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 17:24:25</b>: really anything that ends up being a song or picture in the end usually ends up being a satisfying investment of time.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 17:18:13</b>: this (<a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a>) project is very satisfying to code up. it's got a very nice bottoms-up structure to it that feels very clean. I love systems composed using only a handful of simple operations.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 11:47:38</b>: Apparently, this seems to be my workflow when writing creative software in a <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate style</a>: Dreams/Thoughts->Audible Rambling->Doodles->Structures->Words->Code.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-31 11:30:09</b>: a new breathing card created today: bc12.tizhaimy. one of the first to use wavetables loaded from disk (via the (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) interface).
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-23 10:05:59</b>: I usually try to avoid looking backwards at old work because it prevents me from moving forward (something I enjoy a great deal more). In this case, I it is too tempting to resist.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-23 10:04:37</b>: reproducing some of my old sporth sketches in (<a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>) today. At the (<a href="/wiki/runt">runt</a>) level, they are nearly identical with a few careful tweaks.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-22 11:33:57</b>: I'll also need to make public my sample curation platform too if anyone is going to attempt to try and run it.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-22 11:32:24</b>: a morning spent playing around with 3 random wavetables from the #akwf collection, and trying to do something with it. I've added the results to my #frags collection. It's private for now, but I might open source it? it's messy, but I like being transparent for whatever reason.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-20 17:26:42</b>: picking a sample at random from a library is a totally valid approach to sample curation. So, I added a shuffle feature to the (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) which picks N random elements that match a pattern. This general thing can then be used with (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) to choose random samples from a folder.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-20 10:38:35</b>: at some point, I want to write down my thoughts and notes for creating the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>). but it feels too soon right now.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 10:23:04</b>: some good stuff is happening with the weewiki zet page wrt sample curation. will have to update the (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>) page soon.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 10:50:50</b>: finally got around to jumping back into the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>). I was distracted doing this crate and zet stuff in (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 10:49:10</b>: Created a new group today called @create. Anything to do with creation or creating goes here. Software development is excluded here. #hello
