<p>Yet another <a href="/wiki/metapages">meta-page</a>, tracking
messages from the <code>@create</code> group in this wiki's
<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>.

<p><b>2020-12-20 17:26:42</b>: picking a sample at random from a library is a totally valid approach to sample curation. So, I added a shuffle feature to the (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) which picks N random elements that match a pattern. This general thing can then be used with (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) to choose random samples from a folder.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-20 10:38:35</b>: at some point, I want to write down my thoughts and notes for creating the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>). but it feels too soon right now.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 10:23:04</b>: some good stuff is happening with the weewiki zet page wrt sample curation. will have to update the (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>) page soon.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 10:50:50</b>: finally got around to jumping back into the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>). I was distracted doing this crate and zet stuff in (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 10:49:10</b>: Created a new group today called @create. Anything to do with creation or creating goes here. Software development is excluded here. #hello
