<title>How You Say It</title>
<h1>How You Say It</h1>
<p>It's not what you say, it is how you say it that matters.
</p>
<p>This is a mantra I use in the context of generative music.
I often find there is the temptation to fixate on what is
being played (notes, chords, harmony), and to leave little
to no focus on <b>how</b> the notes are being played
(interpretation, phrasing, orchestration, etc). Computer
generated music that does not consider the hows risks
writing stale music.</p>
