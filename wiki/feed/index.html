I really want (<a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>) to be integrated into (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>) somehow. Both can speak (<a href="/wiki/janet">janet</a>), and I already figured how to embed PNG images inside of an HTML document. In small doses, it could be fun. #halfbakedideas

collecting my half-baked ideas over at (<a href="/wiki/halfbaked">halfbaked</a>)
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-28 12:24:00:</b> 
the idea would be to build and share tiny 6.5 bit programs encoded as printable ascii characters. this could then in turn be read by a virtual computer to do things like paint a picture or compose a piece of music. #halfbakedideas

a 6.5 bit fantasy computer, whose bytecode representation can be represented entirely as printable ascii characters. The first 6 contain standard data space, with the 7th bit used to represent one of 32 values. #halfbakedideas

goodbye blogging? hello wiki-ing and micro-blogging? <a href="/blog/posts/2020-07-27-goodbye_hello.html">a new blog post suddenly appears</a>.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-26 22:29:07:</b> 
built a little script for looking up IDs in twtxt tweets: (<a href="/wiki/twtxt_search">twtxt_search</a>). Going to use it as a way to look up and reference specific tweets in my wiki.

I'm so close to being able to get my literate programs written in (<a href="/wiki/worgle">worgle</a>) converted into a self-contained (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>). #literateprogramming #worgle #weewiki

testing #hashtags
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-26 16:23:18:</b> 
I've been actually thinking about introducing a '#+RELAX' tag in (<a href="/wiki/worgle">worgle</a>) that would explicity turn off strict mode, allowing literate programs to be written more casually.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-26 16:21:29:</b> 
weewiki uses a custom org markup parser written in ANSI C to render the HTML. No emacs needed! my hope is to introduce a user-defined callback that can process these to allow for custom meta-commands.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-26 16:18:52:</b> 
a new fix to (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>) will ignore all org-mode command strings by default. Now things like PROPERTY tags won't show up in the output.

@&lt;hjertnes https://hjertnes.social/twtxt.txt&gt; are you using emacs as twtxt client or something? does it render the org markup for you into links?
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-25 14:37:10:</b> 
@&lt;lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt&gt; very cool idea! may have to try something like that at some point...

It turns out that fts5 is enabled by default on SQLite! My twtxt2sqlite generator has been updated to use fts5. Now I can do full text search on all my twtxt tweets. I have implemented a related-tweets box in the (<a href="/wiki/twtxt_playground">twtxt_playground</a>) as a proof-of-concept. More info on fts5 can be found at <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html">https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html</a>.

</p>
<p><b>2020-07-25 07:49:31:</b> 
Inline Janet means I should be able to make calls to functions defined in the config file. For example, the <code>ref</code> function is how I usually make wiki reference links. This <a href="/wiki/wiki_index">link right here</a> should take you to my automatically generated weewiki index of all the wiki pages.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-25 07:43:06:</b> 
Wow! Inline Janet code <b>does</b> work. What a happy accident. Will use with the upmost restraint.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-25 07:39:02:</b> 
Technically not org, but weewiki org. So this means that I might be able to run inline Janet code? Hello from Janet.</p>
<p><b>2020-07-25 07:36:40:</b> 
I actually think my org markup might work here. Testing a <a href="/proj/patchwerk">link</a>.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 21:39:49:</b> 
here is the script I use to convert my twtxt feed into a SQLite database: (<a href="/wiki/twtxt_sqlite">twtxt_sqlite</a>)
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 21:13:16:</b> 
I'm using a wrapper around txtnish called (<a href="/wiki/say">say</a>) to make it easer to tweet stuff.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 20:52:27:</b> 
a new twtxt/weewiki feature: any word starting with '!' will translate to an internal weewiki reference in my HTML renderer. Example: here is my (<a href="/wiki/wiki_index">wiki_index</a>)
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 13:17:49:</b> 
a unique thing I do with my twtxt feed is convert it to a SQLite database. This, combined with the Janet + SQLite scripting abilities available in SQLite, could provide interesting metrics and insights over time.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 12:57:37:</b> 
there are also things like using #hashtags, which could be a useful tool to coordinate with weewiki somehow.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 12:56:03:</b> 
in particular, twtxt provides timestamps. weewiki doesn't really track the passage of time. it only wants to be a key/value database with org markup.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 12:15:51:</b> 
my hope is that I'll be able integrate this more with my wiki somehow. I think they are a good pairing.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 12:13:57:</b> 
all I have to do is hit "say", write a few bits of things, and then hit ENTER. much easier than using txtnish directly.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 12:11:18:</b> 
made a script that simplifies making twtxt entries. let's see how well it works...

gameboy color speaker replaced using ds lite speaker. sounds quieter than I expected. but better than no sound at all. this, combined with the new case I got for it, makes it almost feel like a brand new device :)
</p>
<p><b>2019-10-05 14:31:31:</b> 
should also note that I have been traveling a lot recently, so the heavy speakers do not travel with me. it is difficult to get re-acquainted with them for this reason.

rx pixel editor looks seen on HN today looks interesting to me (and the sort of thing I've wanted to build), but the vulkan support seems like overkill. Also, my graphics cards drivers are broken on Alpine, so the program probably won't run. trying anyways.
