<h1>twtxt feed</h1>
<p>Last 100 twtxt entries, HTMLized.
</p>
<p>To see all of it, go to my <a href="/twtxt.txt">raw feed</a>.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 20:52:27</b> 
</p>
<p>a new twtxt/weewiki feature: any word starting with '!' will translate to an internal weewiki reference in my HTML renderer. Example: here is my (<a href="/wiki/wiki_index">wiki_index</a>)
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 13:17:49</b> 
</p>
<p>a unique thing I do with my twtxt feed is convert it to a SQLite database. This, combined with the Janet + SQLite scripting abilities available in SQLite, could provide interesting metrics and insights over time.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 12:57:37</b> 
</p>
<p>there are also things like using #hashtags, which could be a useful tool to coordinate with weewiki somehow.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 12:56:03</b> 
</p>
<p>in particular, twtxt provides timestamps. weewiki doesn't really track the passage of time. it only wants to be a key/value database with org markup.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 12:15:51</b> 
</p>
<p>my hope is that I'll be able integrate this more with my wiki somehow. I think they are a good pairing.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 12:13:57</b> 
</p>
<p>all I have to do is hit "say", write a few bits of things, and then hit ENTER. much easier than using txtnish directly.
</p>
<p><b>2020-07-24 12:11:18</b> 
</p>
<p>made a script that simplifies making twtxt entries. let's see how well it works...

<p>building a http server into weewiki has been more useful than I initially expected

<p>weewiki org parser is getting a little bit better. fun bits are long gone, and now it is just tedious bugfixing.

<p>gameboy color speaker replaced using ds lite speaker. sounds quieter than I expected. but better than no sound at all. this, combined with the new case I got for it, makes it almost feel like a brand new device :)
</p>
<p><b>2019-10-05 14:31:31</b> 
</p>
<p>should also note that I have been traveling a lot recently, so the heavy speakers do not travel with me. it is difficult to get re-acquainted with them for this reason.

<p>even though I have these nice hs7 studio monitors on my desk right now, most of my monitoring has been done using my minirig mini. There is just something so irresistable about writing music for something so cute and tiny.

<p>listening richard devine's new album sort/lave today. of course the sounds are top notch, but I really am enjoying how 'composed' it all feels. it really demonstrates true mastery of modular environments.

<p>planck keyboard feels 98% natural to me now. I'm using stiff tactile grey cherry switches on them, which feel great to me, but my fingers need to build up strength for long-term use.

<p>lol build broke. see ya later rx.

<p>rx pixel editor looks seen on HN today looks interesting to me (and the sort of thing I've wanted to build), but the vulkan support seems like overkill. Also, my graphics cards drivers are broken on Alpine, so the program probably won't run. trying anyways.

<p>added paragraph blocks and code blocks to weewiki HTML output. things look decent.

<p>Maybe it's just me getting older, but there is something very satisfying about seeing big chunky text on screen. Currently using an Atari font on my computer. Once your eyes get used to it, it's actually quite lovely.
