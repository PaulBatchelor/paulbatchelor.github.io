with (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) and (<a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a>), I find myself constantly needing to type out UUIDs. thing is, they aren't the easiest thing to type. might invent an intermediate typer-friendly intermediate UUID format that can then convert to the regular UUID format. #halfbaked

don't get me wrong, I love the power of emacs. but it's a very complex piece of software, which is inherrently brittle. not a problem in the short term, but for some of my more long term tools it's a consideration.

<p><b>2021-01-28 18:03:14:</b>

I've recently been reading up on zettelkastens again, since it is very closely related to the ethos of a personal wiki system like (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>). The thing that interests me is the emergent patterns that come from linking things to things.

<p><b>2020-11-02 10:09:43:</b> 
not to mention there's lots of interesting transformations one can apply to the linear ramp of a phasor signal. movable midpoint as seen in phase distortion synthesis and (<a href="/wiki/phasewarp">phasewarp</a>). exponential and <a href="/sndkit/bezier">bezier</a> mappings. Not to mention all the trig functions and waveshaping synthesis techniques. All these things would warp tempo in interesting periodic ways. #halfbakedideas

<p><b>2020-11-02 10:04:37:</b> 
it's also easy to use scaling and wrap operations to transform a phasor signal into smaller/larger phasor signals, allowing for interesting rhythmic microcosms that stay in sync #halfbakedideas

<p><b>2020-11-02 10:02:05:</b> 
I'm hoping to build a phasor-to-clock signal generator, which divides up a phasor into an arbitrary number of ticks. Using a global phasor as a global clock would allow for interesting polyrhythms, as well more flexible precision in sequencers. It's also closer to how human-based conducting works. #halfbakedideas
