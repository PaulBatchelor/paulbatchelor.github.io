<title>Musical Software Ecosystem</title>
<h1>Musical Software Ecosystem</h1>
<p>A software ecosystem is a self-contained collection of
programs and utilties designed to tightly work together.
Each new tool built empowers the rest of the system. A
<b>music</b> software ecosystem is one that primarily focuses
on making music.
</p>
<p>This page will outline the musical ecosystem that I have
built for myself.
</p>
<p>Well, what exactly does it <b>mean</b> to make computer music?
</p>
<p>For starters, it's got to make sound somehow. The low-level
library I use for musical DSP is called <a href="/wiki/soundpipe">soundpipe</a>.
This provides a good collection of low-level sound goodies,
but not a particular friendly way to mix them together. At
the C level, every tiny musical idea translates into several
dozen actions in Soundpipe + C. Things must therefore be
built on top of Soundpipe to do anything practical.
</p>
<p>A common thing that one does in computer music is build
virtual modular patches, where things connect into things
which connect into things which connect into things. This
is known as modular synthesis. Based on the analogue
equivalent, it is an excellent and time-honored mental model
for constructing digital sounds. Do these kinds of
operations, <a href="/wiki/patchwerk">patchwerk</a> is used. Patchwerk builds
up what are more formally known as directed audio graphs
with block-based signal processing.
</p>
<p>Patchwerk, like Soundpipe, is still a bit too low level to
do anything too creative. A lot of menial tasks are needed
even to construct the simplest sound. As luck would have it,
<a href="#">Stack-based systems</a> prove
to be an excellent way to expressively notate directed audio
graphs.
This is where <a href="/wiki/runt">the Runt scripting language</a> comes into play. Built before Patchwerk, Runt has been
repurposed to be the de-facto way to interact
with Patchwerk.
</p>
<p>Computer music isn't just about getting sound to come out of
computer. In fact, that's not all that important.
The more important bit is where the human tells the
computer what kinds of sounds should come out. Enter
Human-Computer interaction, otherwise known as
<a href="#">HCI</a></p>
<p>The tools mentioned so far focus on making the sounds
themselves, but not on the process of actually
<b>developing</b> the sounds. For this, you need systems that
promote interaction with fast-to-realtime feedback, as well
as iteration and the general sound-tweaking that comes with
the craft. There are excellent physical peripherals for these
sorts of things like <a href="/wiki/monome_grid">the grid</a> and
<a href="/wiki/arc">the arc</a>. There's also the wonderful world
of <a href="#">live and interactive coding</a>.
These are the sorts of problem-space that <a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a> aims to solve. In Monolith, Runt-patchwerk
code is evaluated by <a href="/wiki/scheme">scheme</a> code. The resulting
patch is able to run in realtime with hotswapping
capabilities. This combined with a scheme REPL in
<a href="#">emacs</a> makes for a very capable live-coding
environment. Also baked into monolith is good integration
with hardware peripherals like the monome grid, arc, as
well as the <a href="/wiki/griffin">griffin powermate</a>.
</p>
<p>Composing music is a very cerebral act. In addition to tools
for making music, there are tools that help to organize
thoughts around making music itself. Most of my tools that I
write employ a <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate programming style</a>, many of which are written
using a literate programming system I developed called <a href="/wiki/worgle">Worgle</a>. For organizing non-linear ideas and
concepts, there is <a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>.
</p>
<p>Monolith, Weewiki, and Worgle all use <a href="/wiki/sqlite">sqlite</a> as
a <a href="/wiki/convergence">sort of lingua franca</a>, which I
believe to be a significant aspect of my musical ecosystem.</p>
