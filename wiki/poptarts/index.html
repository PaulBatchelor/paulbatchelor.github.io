<h1>Homemade Brown Sugar Cinnamon Poptarts</h1>
<p>Consolidated from a recipe I've been using.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>


<h4>Pasty Dough</h4>

<p>1 1/2 cups flour
</p>
<p>1 teaspoon sugar
</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon salt
</p>
<p>1/2 cup chilled unsalted butter, cut into cubes
</p>
<p>1/4 cup cold water
</p>

<h4>Filling</h4>

<p>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
</p>
<p>1 tablespoon flour
</p>
<p>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
</p>
<p>2 teaspoons molasses
</p>
<p>2+ tablespoons melted butter
</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>


<h4>Pastry Dough</h4>

<p>Mix flour and sugar into bowl. Use a pastry blender
to cut in cubed butter until mixture resembles small
peas. Gradually mix in water, ~1 tablespoon at a time, until
it starts to form into a dough.
</p>
<p>Roll out flat (about 1/2 inch or so), wrap in plastic wrap
or container, and chill for at least an hour.
</p>

<h4>Filling</h4>

<p>Combine the brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Mix in the
molasses. The melted butter comes next.
</p>

<h4>Assembly</h4>

<p>More or less do the following:
</p>
<p>Roll out the pastry dough.
</p>
<p>Cut up into squares or rectangles. (I use a 3 inch
square cutter).
</p>
<p>Brush melted butter on squares.
</p>
<p>Spoon about a tablespoon of filling onto every other
square.
</p>
<p>Take another square and place it on top of the other
square. Butter side down.
</p>
<p>Press to seal the edges, and use a fork to finish the job.
</p>
<p>Chill these in the freezer for about 5 minutes until they
are firm.
</p>
<p>Take them out, and use a toothpick to create some holes at
the top. This is done to let out steam.
</p>
<p>Place in the oven at 350 degrees on a cooking sheet with
parchment paper. Cook until it starts to brown, usually
about 10-12 minutes?</p>
