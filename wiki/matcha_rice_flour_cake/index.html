<title>Matcha Rice Flour Cake</title>
<h1>Matcha Rice Flour Cake</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A gluten free steamed matcha cake made with rice flour.
Based on a youtube video I saw for making plain rice cake.
I halved the batch, added matcha and vanilla, and tweaked
the sugar and milk until it was a pretty good flavor and
texture.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>2 eggs (separated into yolks and whites)
</p>
<p>15ml oil
</p>
<p>55ml milk
</p>
<p>70g rice flour
</p>
<p>5g culinary grade matcha powder
</p>
<p>Vanilla extract
</p>
<p>1/4 tsp cream of tartar
</p>
<p>45g sugar
</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>Mix yolks, oil and milk together.
</p>
<p>Add in rice flour, then add the matcha. Blend well and
make sure the matcha doesn't clump up.
</p>
<p>Mix in vanilla.
</p>
<p>In another bowl, whisk egg whites
until they begin to froth. Add cream of tartar, and continue
whisking, slowly adding in the sugar. Whisk until medium
peak.
</p>
<p>Fold in egg whites into the batter. Try to do this in about
3 parts. Make sure it is well mixed, and there are no streaks.
</p>
<p>Pour in a round cake pan (The original recipe says
not to grease your pan, I ever so slightly grease mine
because it is stainless steel).
</p>
<p>Place cake pan in steamer and steam. Steam time will
vary, but it does take longer
than <a href="/wiki/steamed_cakes">other steamed cakes</a>.
On my Tatung rice cooker, I used 2 tatung measuring
cups of water.
</p>
<p>Let cool completely.
