<h1>Plans for Toys</h1>
<p><a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">toys not tools</a> is a
mantra I recently have adapated for myself, and hope
to explore in 2021. Here are some tasks I have set
for myself, populated in <a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a> found
in this wiki.
</p>
<p></p>

<h2>brainstorm: project blkhed</h2>

<a id="0d4a8a0f"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#0d4a8a0f">#0d4a8a0f</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2022-03-21 20:17:48</b>: I'm in the process of rethinking my singing synthesizer, so that's a factor. Also, what it could mean to sing. Also, interface, especially in the context of gesture. There's a lot of balls in the air.
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-21 20:16:18</b>: some explantion is warranted. I've always wanted to put a face on some of my more vocal-y song-y chirp-y things. Instead of waiting to figure out how to make decent faces, why not just use a few rectangles? Could be black and white too. Wonder how far that will take me.

<h2>create bitblok editor and format</h2>

<a id="660c7df8"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#660c7df8">#660c7df8</a>.
</p>
<p>at the time of writing, only the format loader/parser had been made. I've sketched out a very simple editor for it which I'd like to code up in SDL.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2022-09-26 08:13:55</b>: out of scope for my current goals and needs. taking off priority list.
</p>
<p><b>2022-05-18 09:38:17</b>: I made a sketch of the workflow as I see it in my head at the moment. I'm trying to restrict the number of operations and conventions to keep things simple. This is a sort of program scoped for very small things.
</p>
<p><b>2022-05-16 08:55:45</b>: I want to sketch out this interface (again). I feel myself putting it off.
</p>
<p><b>2022-05-12 09:43:21</b>: I am losing motivation for this one. I'm tempted to just try and make gfx2 work for me.
</p>
<p><b>2022-04-15 09:25:46</b>: reminder that bitblok initial work is in 1bit/gfx
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-23 09:36:23</b>: this one is important to future creative projects that involve visuals, so I am bumping it up in priority.
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-13 11:04:51</b>: bitblok also has an emphasis on tilemaps and tessellations, which my brain seems to enjoy.
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-13 11:03:55</b>: Why bitblok? I'm trying to motivate myself to create again, and work towards more gaming oriented stuff. I'm not an artist, and while tiny 1-bit art has challenges, it feels more approachable compared to other mediums.
