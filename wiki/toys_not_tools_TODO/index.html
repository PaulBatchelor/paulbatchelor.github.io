<h1>Plans for Toys</h1>
<p><a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">toys not tools</a> is a
mantra I recently have adapated for myself, and hope
to explore in 2021. Here are some tasks I have set
for myself, populated in <a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a> found
in this wiki.
</p>
<p></p>

<h2>brainstorm initial project for Daisy Pod</h2>

<a id="424e6d81"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#424e6d81">#424e6d81</a>.
</p>
<p>it'll be a toy. give it a name. give it a destination.

<h2>rework orb to use new android build system</h2>

<a id="fca513ab"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#fca513ab">#fca513ab</a>.
</p>
<p>use the new android build system I've been developing and apply it to (<a href="#">orb</a>).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-22 09:18:13</b>: part of this will require getting a local copy of old soundpipe. that's the tricky part. the other parts shouldn't be too bad.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>brainstorm: strategize bringing back voc and speech synthesis as a toy.</h2>

<a id="d2737f81"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#d2737f81">#d2737f81</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-21 08:24:13</b>: one of the challenges with vocal synthesis in general is articulation. Changing between phoneme states in a meaningful way. sequencing for that is non-trivial. tools will have to be built. My hope is to develop a singing-chatter like sound. something that is part speech, part song. I think it would work really well for an android app.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 08:21:48</b>: in addition to the Voc stuff, I also want to bring GROWL back, as it was one of my favorite vowel filters: <a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/GROWL">https://github.com/paulbatchelor/GROWL</a>.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 08:20:51</b>: I got my android operation working again, which opens up some new opportunities for me. this would be a great place to use speech synthesis in the form of anthropomorphic toys.
