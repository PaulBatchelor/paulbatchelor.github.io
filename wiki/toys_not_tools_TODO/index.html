<title>Plans for Toys</title>
<h1>Plans for Toys</h1>
<p><a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">toys not tools</a> is a
mantra I recently have adapated for myself, and hope
to explore in 2021. Here are some tasks I have set
for myself, populated in <a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a> found
in this wiki.
</p>
<p></p>

<h2>brainstorm initial project for Daisy Pod</h2>

<a id="424e6d81"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#424e6d81">#424e6d81</a>.
</p>
<p>it'll be a toy. give it a name. give it a destination.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-07-20 21:09:08</b>: this would be a noteworthy technical effort because it would require working with fixed memory. I think it could be doable.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-20 21:08:17</b>: since I've been interested in vocal synthesis, perhaps the system could involve that. I wonder if (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) could even work on this thing as well with some tweaks
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-20 21:07:19</b>: A self-contained generative composition would be an easy thing to do. No interaction, just start it and go.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h2>brainstorm: strategize bringing back voc and speech synthesis as a toy.</h2>

<a id="d2737f81"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#d2737f81">#d2737f81</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-07-15 13:02:21</b>: I had this wild idea of creating a babble bot using procedurally generated phrases created with (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>). the idea would be that you would move in a 2d space, and depending on where you are and what direction you're moving, the kinds of phrases that are generated would change.
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-05 12:26:20</b>: From the tool building angle, (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) is evolving quite nicely and could be used to create some interesting toys. But those toys need a narrative involving singing, speech and the places in between. There's a lot of interesting directions of course, which is part of the problem. For all intents and purposes, the tools have been made, just not yet implemented. Where to go now?
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-05 12:23:43</b>: lots of things have been in motion since I wrote this task. Including (<a href="/wiki/vocshape">vocshape</a>), and the underlying <a href="/sndkit/tract">tract</a> and <a href="/sndkit/glottis">glottis</a> components in (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>). These are good starts, but are currently kind of aimless projects, with not enough toy in them.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 08:24:13</b>: one of the challenges with vocal synthesis in general is articulation. Changing between phoneme states in a meaningful way. sequencing for that is non-trivial. tools will have to be built. My hope is to develop a singing-chatter like sound. something that is part speech, part song. I think it would work really well for an android app.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 08:21:48</b>: in addition to the Voc stuff, I also want to bring GROWL back, as it was one of my favorite vowel filters: <a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/GROWL">https://github.com/paulbatchelor/GROWL</a>.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-21 08:20:51</b>: I got my android operation working again, which opens up some new opportunities for me. this would be a great place to use speech synthesis in the form of anthropomorphic toys.

<h2>cute singing cartoon characters</h2>

<a id="32681f7c"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#32681f7c">#32681f7c</a>.
</p>
<p>I don't know any other way to describe this. I want to build cute characters that sing and chitter. And I want people to play with them, feed them, and generally take care of them.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-07-05 12:41:26</b>: maintence/caring/nurturing as a form of of composition.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-23 20:06:39</b>: above all, this is still a 'composition'. music should be produced, whatever that is. the experience of it will feel more holistic.
