<h1>Plans for Toys</h1>
<p><a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">toys not tools</a> is a
mantra I recently have adapated for myself, and hope
to explore in 2021. Here are some tasks I have set
for myself, populated in <a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a> found
in this wiki.
</p>

<h3>bring back android interactive audio projects</h3>

<a id="33a516b2"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#33a516b2">#33a516b2</a>.
</p>
<p>this is a planning-to-action task. generally, it is about setting up a manageable toolchain for making interactive audio apps using just C, NDK, and nanovg. There are some interesting makefile android projects that don't use ndkbuild that look promising.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-19 21:09:22</b>: after I make this start project a little more musical, I think I'll be back in business from a tooling standpoint. then it is off the hard part of actually making toys.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-19 20:37:13</b>: make more musical demo patch with proof-of concept android
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-17 10:40:26</b>: create proof of-concept opensl sound example
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-17 10:39:51</b>: create proof-of-concept nanovg example
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-17 09:49:27</b>: get rawdrawandroid working without IDE and document progress on wiki
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-17 09:48:20</b>: working on getting the android project working on my alpine + arch chroot setup. will take better notes this time.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-16 09:26:05</b>: what is also exciting is that rawdrawandroid seems to be able to get keyboard input as well with a pop-up screen. so that opens some doors too.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-16 09:25:32</b>: after that, the hope is to get a proof of concept app that uses nanovg and opensl for audio. I know how to do all this natively, but I've never done it using just using makefiles, so this is exciting to me.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-16 09:14:14</b>: going to try repeating the process on my arch chroot on alpine, then documenting it on this wiki.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-16 09:13:43</b>: got rawdrawandroid project working last night! this is a big deal because it is a project that is all C and Makefiles, no Java glue code and gradle. What doubly makes this a big deal is that I managed to do it without relying on starting up android studio.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 09:52:11</b>: years ago, I had a number of interactive sound toys that ran on low-end android devices. It is about I jump back into that.

<h4>make more musical demo patch with proof-of concept android</h4>

<a id="3213ee4b"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#3213ee4b">#3213ee4b</a>.
</p>
<p>at the moment, the demo patch is just a circle with some noise. not very compelling. improve this.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-19 20:40:33</b>: an fm oscillator with vibrato via a oscillator, and some reverb.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-19 20:40:12</b>: this would try to use existing things in (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>).
</p>

<h3>brainstorm: strategize bringing back voc and speech synthesis as a toy.</h3>

<h3>add a toy language to sndkit</h3>

<a id="6e461a29"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#6e461a29">#6e461a29</a>.
</p>
<p>embed sndkit algorithms in a usable toy language (thinking about (<a href="/wiki/LIL">LIL</a>)) that would allow one to build up patches using (<a href="/wiki/patchwerk">patchwerk</a>).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-17 21:02:13</b>: this is in progress. currently building an initial C API. LIL will follow shortly after, mirroring the C API pretty closely.
