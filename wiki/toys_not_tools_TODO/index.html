<h1>Plans for Toys</h1>
<p><a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">toys not tools</a> is a
mantra I recently have adapated for myself, and hope
to explore in 2021. Here are some tasks I have set
for myself, populated in <a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a> found
in this wiki.
</p>
<p></p>

<h3>brainstorm: strategize bringing back voc and speech synthesis as a toy.</h3>

<blockquote>

<h3>add a toy language to sndkit</h3>

<p>embed sndkit algorithms in a usable toy language (thinking about (<a href="/wiki/LIL">LIL</a>)) that would allow one to build up patches using (<a href="/wiki/patchwerk">patchwerk</a>).
</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>bring back android interactive audio projects</h3>

<p>this is a planning-to-action task. generally, it is about setting up a manageable toolchain for making interactive audio apps using just C, NDK, and nanovg. There are some interesting makefile android projects that don't use ndkbuild that look promising.
</p>

<p><b>2021-02-09 09:52:11</b>: years ago, I had a number of interactive sound toys that ran on low-end android devices. It is about I jump back into that.
