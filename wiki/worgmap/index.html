<h1>Worgmap</h1>
<p>Worgmap is a utility included with Worgle.
</p>
<p>The creation of Worgmap started off with a crazy idea: what
could happen if Worgle was able to generate small SQLite
databases from programs written in Worgle? Worgmap is an
attempt at answering this question.
</p>
<p>Worgmap is a small commandline utility designed to navigate
a generated database from worgle and extract meaningful bits
of information. At the time of writing, this consists of a
simple "get" interface, and some very initial code for an
HTML and dot code exporter.
</p>
<p>Worgmap will continue to grow based on the needs of software
and tools written in using Worgle.</p>
