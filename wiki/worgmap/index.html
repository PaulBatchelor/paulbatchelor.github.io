<h1>Worgmap</h1>
<p>Worgmap is a utility included with <a href="/wiki/worgle">Worgle</a>.
</p>

<h3>Origin Story</h3>

<p>The creation of Worgmap started off with a crazy idea: what
could happen if Worgle was able to generate small SQLite
databases from programs written in Worgle? Worgmap is an
attempt at answering this question.
</p>
<p>Worgmap is a small commandline utility designed to navigate
a generated database from worgle and extract meaningful bits
of information. At the time of writing, this consists of a
simple "get" interface, and some very initial code for an
HTML and dot code exporter.
</p>
<p>Worgmap will continue to grow based on the needs of software
and tools written in using Worgle.
</p>

<h3>Sample Usage</h3>

<p>In the worgle codebase, a database can be generated by
running <code>make db</code>. This will produce a SQLite database
called <code>a.db</code>, which is what worgmap reads by default.
</p>
<p>Worgmap can list all the tangled files with the
<code>filelist</code> command.
</p>
<pre><code>$ worgmap get filelist
worgle.c
worgle.h
worgle_private.h
sorg.c
db.c
db.h</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>More specific file information on say, db.c can be retrieved
with <code>ffile</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>$ worgmap get ffile
id = 7
filename = db.c
top = 5 (db-top)
next_file = 15
program id = 2</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Amongst the information, this tells us that the top code
block is called "db-top". The program ID is an identifier
that allows separately tangled program to exist in one
database.
</p>
<p>The hierarchy code block structure can be printed for
db.c via the top block using <code>tree</code>. The program id (2) must
be supplied. Trees are a great way to get the idea a
program as it is seen in code rather than in how it is
presented in the markup.
</p>
<pre><code>$ worgmap get tree db-top 2
static_db_functions
functions
 schemas
 inserts</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>The <code>functions</code> codeblock is used to store all the
functions. It is composed of multiple block segments. Each
reference can be found using <code>blkref</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>$ worgmap get blkref functions 2
db.org:40
db.org:55
db.org:73
db.org:386
db.org:417
db.org:489
db.org:585
db.org:669
db.org:757
db.org:782
db.org:842</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Tools like <code>blkref</code> can help mitigate spaghetti-code logic
that can sometimes appear in literate programming
environments that allow code to be declared out of order
and/or in completely different places.</p>
