<h1>Gesture</h1>

<h2>What is Gesture?</h2>

<p>I'm assuming that you, the reader, are already familiar with
the word <code>Gesture</code>. The definition provided by
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gesture">wiktionary</a> refers to
gesture as:
</p>
<p>A motion of the limbs or body, especially one to
made to emphasize speech.
</p>
<p>This is a good start, though my thoughts on Gesture in
music. So, building on that definition, I would describe
Gesture as:
</p>
<p>An implied continuous motion in music, especially one made
to emphasize structure or meaning.
</p>
<p>In the context of computer generated music, gestures
can be constructed from line generators, that can be
used to modulate other parameters.
</p>
<p>An automation curve is a pretty common means to generate
gestures. An envelope generator modulating the timbre or
amplitude envelope of a sound can be thought of as a
gesture. Even discrete notes from an arpeggiating step
sequencer are in their own ways, Gesture.
</p>
<p>Gestures can be many things, but the main thing is that
it is a continuous action with some sort of intent. A
sonic <code>gestalt</code> of sorts.
</p>
<p>An imperfect mental model is to think of all music as being
a collection of gestures, working together to
construct the lowest level perceptual units of music such as
the "note", to higher-level musical considerations like
phrasing and form.
</p>

<h2>Why Do We Need to Think about Gesture</h2>

<p>I think about Gesture in the context of computer
generated music. The current way computer-based
is typically thought about is limiting and often
has a distinct flatness associated with computer music.
Computer generated lyrical music in particular fails
quite spectacularly.
</p>
<p>By rethinking things in terms of Gesture, the hope
is the outcome will yield computer-generated music that ties
back to music traditionals in a more organic and profound
way.
</p>

<h2>The Status Quo Of Computer Generated Music</h2>

<p>The way musical performance is represented on a
computer is MIDI. It's been the core way of thinking
about music.
</p>
<p>The elephant in the room is that it is highly pianocentric
protocol, invented by keyboardists, for keyboardists. Not
only does this influence instrument design, but it warps
our entire view of what music is. Anything that does
fall with the standard conventions of a keyboard (the human
voice, bowed instruments like violins, theremin), is going
to struggle getting MIDI to work to control it, if it
can at all.
</p>
<p>MIDI, using the piano as the core instrument, strongly
implies a few falsehoods about music and musical
performance:
</p>
<p>1. Music is a discrete medium. Note events strongly imply
that music is nothing more than a sequence of patterns.
In practice, music is a continuous medium, that often
gets perceived in discrete chunks known as "notes". Humans
can interpret notes on a score and implicitely add the
necessary conversion and interpretations to make it
a continuous action. Computers do not have this ability,
and must be told how to perform these notes. Otherwise,
you are left with lackluster stiff musical performances.
</p>
<p>2. Notes in music have a distinct start and end. Lyrical
and monophonic instruments like the voice or the thermin
or the pedalsteel guitar can be ambiguous about where
notes explicitely start and end.
</p>
<p>3. Instruments have arbitrary polyphony. Keyboard
instruments like the Piano, Organ, and Harpischord are
exceptionally polyphonic, to an almost unnatural extent.
Most instruments in the world are monophonic.
Building monophonic instruments using MIDI is challenging.
Implementing polyphony on a synthesizer can also be quite
challenging.
</p>
<p>As a result of this, many computer music efforts focus on
things that MIDI lends itself well towards: generating
pitch sequences and homophonic chord progressions. With
piano-mind, it is hard to think of anything else.
</p>
<p>With Gesture, more emphasis would be put into the underlying
phrasing of pitch sequences, rather than a fixation
on the sequences themselves. In other words: <b>how</b>something is said instead of <b>what</b> is being said. Gesture
also lends itself better to monophonic instruments rather
than polyphony instruments. This would lead to more emphasis
in ensembles of multi-monophonic instruments playing harmony
that is more contrapuntal in nature.
</p>

<h2>Western Music Theory in Terms of Gesture</h2>

<p>This is a work in progress. But the gist of it is:
can we rethink classical western music theory in
terms of gesture? And if so, how does it affect
the way we relate and think about musical structure?
</p>
<p>Goes like this:
</p>
<p>Gesture is an abstraction, inspired by the human singing
voice.
</p>
<p>The human singing voice is the foundation of Western
Tonal Music.
</p>
<p>From the voice, we have speech and language. We have
inflection and prosody. This eventual gives us melody.
By magic, we have the major scale, which is kind of
based on the overtone series, but kind of not.
</p>
<p>Melody generation comes next. How does one make a good
melody? Stepwise motion, intervals, etc. Gesture brings
in an aspect of performance and phrasing. Bring in the voice
again. Breathing and prosody shape phrasing and melody
construction.
</p>
<p>When two or more voices sing together, it is counterpoint.
Counterpoint existed before Species Counterpoint. How
do you get lines to sing well together?
</p>
<p>From counterpoint, you derive Tonal Harmony. Melody
considers the horizontal for a voice. Counterpoint
considers melody for simultaneous voices. Harmony considers
the vertical relationship of those voices and measures
how they sound together. Gesture?</p>
