<title>Gesture</title>
<h1>Gesture</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Gesture, as seen in the context of computer music
composition, is an area of interest actively explored
in this wiki. Projects like <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a> and
<a href="/wiki/gestvm">gestvm</a> work with the notion of Gesture, while
<a href="/wiki/CATFMAS">other ideas</a> do so more implicitely.
</p>
<p>Gesture here refers to a set of specific
methods and techniques. The goal of Gesture is to provide
simple and intuitive ways to build expressive computer
generated musical performances. In particular, there
is an emphasis at exploring procedurally generated
musical lyricism in synthesized sound (think Clara Rockmore
performing "Vocalise" on the Theremin). Use
with singing synthesis in particular is a focus, as
seen in <a href="/wiki/looptober_2021">looptober_2021</a> and <a href="/wiki/CATFMAS">CATFMAS</a>.
</p>

<h2>General Definition</h2>

<p><a href="/wiki/websters1913">Websters 1913 Dictionary</a> defines
Gesture as "Any action or posture intended to express
an idea or passion". In Music, Gesture as a concept is
frequently used by performers to help shape phrasing, both
in the sound, as well physically on a musical instrument.
Gesture implies a continuous motion underneath discrete
notes on a page. It is used to give notes context in
the overall musical passage. Musicians can manipulate
notes with gesture several ways including timing, timbre,
dynamics, articulation, and sometimes pitch.
</p>
<p>A more common definition is "A motion of the limbs or
body made to express or help express thought or to
emphasize speech."
</p>

<h2>Gesture in Computer Music</h2>

<p>Gesture in Computer Music tends to map to sounds more
directly, rather than being something that is "underneath"
a note (several computer music works and composers
philosophically unravel the conventional notion of a
"note".)
</p>
<p>In modular synthesis, anything that is considered a control
signal generator has the potential to be used to explicitly
create a gesture. An LFO modulating pitch or an
envelope controlling filter cutoff could be thought of
as a kind of gesture. Just as these components can build up
a synthesizer instrument, gestures can coordinate and work
together to produce a sound a musical phrase of notes.
</p>
<p>This linen of thinking of Gesture as an explicit signal
to be used to control parameters is where algorithms and
techniques begin to emerge.
</p>

<h2>Gesture Synthesis and Sequencing</h2>

<p>The terms <code>gesture synthesis</code> and <code>gesture sequencing</code> are
commonly used interchangeably because of how closely
they are related.
</p>
<p>Gesture Synthesis refers to the class of DSP algorithms
utilized to produce the signal, which should be computed
at audio-rate. Gesture synthesizers are glorified breakpoint
line generators that use relative timings based on an
external clock signal.
</p>
<p>The external clock signal, known as a <code>conductor</code>, is
a <code>phasor</code>, or a periodic rising ramp signal going from
0 to 1. Phasor clocks can be divided in a generalized way
using <code>phase-locked looping</code>. No knowledge of tempo is
required, and the process is nearly instantaneous, usually
only requiring 1-4 samples of delay for analysis.
</p>
<p>Ramps produced from a Conductor are used to interpolate
between two discrete values to produce a line. Before
interpolating, the ramp can go through a transformation
to change the curve somehow, in what is known as a
<code>behavior</code>.
</p>
<p>Gesture Sequencing the means for telling what the
Gesture Synthesizer will perform. This involves programming
the breakpoints, durations, and behaviors. In <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>, this is done by using commands to produce
a tree structure representing rhythmic subdivisions,
and targets being at the leaf nodes of the tree. In
<a href="/wiki/gestvm">gestvm</a>, the underlying synthesizer is
manipulated using a modified version of the <a href="#">Uxn</a> VM.
</p>

<h2>TODO Gesture Related Concepts</h2>

<p>Using Gesture as a model for structuring music, a few
interesting concepts emerge related to timing. This
includes Temporal Skewing and <a href="/wiki/temporal_weight">temporal weight</a>.

<p>More words to come later.

<h2>TODO Pros and Cons</h2>

<p>What happens when you think in terms of Gesture? The good,
the bad. More words to come later.
