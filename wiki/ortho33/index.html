<title>Ortho33</title>
<h1>Ortho33</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><code>Ortho33</code> is a constrained input system designed
to work with a 3x3 ortholinear keypad, such as the one
found on a standard numberpad.
</p>
<p>The system is a chorded system, consisting of combination
of 3 unique button presses that can be pressed in any order.
On a 3x3 grid, these produce shapes, which can be used to
help remember different gestures.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Strange Symbols require Strange Input Systems.
</p>
<p>The Ortho33 input system was devised initially as a potential
way to input in symbols and runes for esolangs and notation
systems, such as those being developed
for the <a href="/wiki/gestlings">Gestlings Project</a>.
</p>
<p>The idea to use a 3x3 grid was inspired by an interest
in ortholinear and grid interfaces such as
the <a href="/wiki/planck">planck</a> and
the <a href="/wiki/monome_grid">Monome grid</a>. 3x3 grids
are practically because they exist on numberpads, which
are both ubiquitous and inexpensive. Furthermore, 3x3
keypads are compact, and could lend themselves well
towards <a href="#">mobile and portable creative workflows</a>.
</p>
<p>At
the time of writing this, this input system is only theoretical
and hasn't been utilized outside of a prototyping
enviornment. A block editor for symbols is in the works.
</p>

<h2>Shapes</h2>

<p>One of the core concepts of using a 3x3 grid is that shapes
become realized as visual-spatial relationships, which can
be used as an mnemonic device.
</p>
<p>The table below shows a set of curated shapes, each with
a label that very abstractly describes what the shape is:
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/ortho33/ortho33.png" alt="table of named shapes">
</p>
<p>Some names take more creative liberties than others. For
example, "dog" is named because the shape somewhat resembles
a Yorkshire Terrier. "Pegasus" is also the dog shape, but
raised a little bit higher, which suggests a flying dog.
Pegasus is the name of a flying horse, which is conceptually
related to a flying dog.
</p>

<h2>Ergonomic Considerations</h2>

<p>The ortho33 system was developed with ergonomics in mind.
</p>
<p>ortho33 gestures are intended to be performed on a mechanicm
numberpad using the right hand (though it could easily be
configured for the left hand as well), using the index,
middle, and ring finger. 3 fingers map to 3 keys.
</p>
<p>It is important to devise an intuition for a comfortable
fingering system for inputting in shapes.
</p>
<p>Rolling your fingers on the table, you will find that
ring, middle, index is a more comfortable direction than
index, middle, ring. Finger movement should always be
used in this order. If two fingers are being used, the
order would be middle, then index. One should avoid having
to repeat a finger. This alternating finger strategy is
done in order to maintain a rhythm.
</p>
<p>Some shapes are more comfortable than others. Rows
such as "321", "654", and "987" are quite comfortable,
while columns like "471", "582", and "693", require
more contortion of the hand (uncomfortable), or repeating a
finger (throws off the rhythm).
</p>

<h2>Leader Key</h2>

<p>To add more extensibility, a "leader" key can be picked to
execute commands. This key gets pressed at the start of
a chord, and changes the state of the input mode to listen
for another layer of shapes instead of the 3-shapes.
</p>
<p>In the current ortho33 prototype, 2-key chord shapes are
made with the leader key, allowing for a total of 9 extra
shapes that can be used for commands.
</p>
<p>In practice, it has been important to have a visual indicator
when the leader key has been activated, and a way to cancel
the current shape, such as hitting a key twice.
</p>
<p>'1' (bottom left) is a good candidate for a leader key
because it contrasts from the the right-to-left ring-middle-index
ergonomic affordances. Any chorded gesture starting with 1
would cause a bit of a break in the shape input rhythm,
which is desirable since it is a dinstinctly different
verb.
</p>

<h2>Rotary Encoder Support</h2>

<p>In the ortho33 prototype, ascii keys corresponding counter-clockwise
and clockwise have been added in order to support ascii-driven
multimedia rotary encoders such as the <a href="/wiki/bnr1">bnr1</a>. This
extra feature was added simply because low-latency ASCII
input was the only thing I managed to get working on the BNR1
via QMK so far (raw HID didn't work, and MIDI is TBD, though
I'm starting to appreciate the elegance of it being a
plug-and-play keyboard).
