<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>A work in progress concept, that all started with an idea:
</p>
<p><blockquote>
<b>2020-08-04 12:33:52:</b> an extendable text editor inside of a Blit that tries really hard not to edit text. #halfbakedideas
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>This, combined with my <a href="/wiki/1bit">1bit</a> aesthetics, led me
to come up with this concept I'm calling "bitwrite".
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>The main goal is to build a means for me to boostrap my way
into buildinng graphical user interfaces from my familiar
keyboard-driven workflow. The idea is to build things that
are a bit better than the TUIs you'd see made by ncurses,
but not as sophisticated as something like imGUI. I also
hope to give the system a simple core with a very flexible
C API. That way, bitwrite can be easily modified and
extended.
</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>The whole process starts with the wonderfully simple Kilo
text editor, and porting it to a simple bitmap GUI via SDL
'and <a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>. Bitmap fonts will be baked in using
the xbm format.
</p>
<p>Kilo internally treats text internally as a set of rows.
Instead of writing to a text file, Kilo will be modified
to write to a <a href="/wiki/sqlite">SQLite database</a> as a kind
of file format. This is where Kilo stops
being a text editor, and starts becoming a text interface.
With any luck, this approach will allow for more
extendability of bitwrite, and also help <a href="/wiki/convergence">better integrate with my existing software </a>that also uses SQLite.
</p>
<p>A command language will be added. Hitting alt-enter on
the current line will allow the line to be evaluated by
this interpreter.
</p>
<p>Kilo structures things in terms of rows of text. Instead of
text, this concept of a row will be expanded to be a region
of pixels. A program interface will be written that allows a
row to be occupied and written to in any arbitrary way. Not
just text. The row height can be adjusted, but the width
will remain fixed.
</p>
<p>New programs can be save/loaded to the SQLite file.
</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<b>2021-01-02 11:22:23</b>: created a (<a href="/wiki/bitwrite">bitwrite</a>) page in this wikis (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>).
