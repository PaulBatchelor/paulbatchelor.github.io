<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A work in progress concept, that all started with an idea:
</p>
<p><blockquote>
<b>2020-08-04 12:33:52:</b> an extendable text editor inside of a Blit that tries really hard not to edit text. #halfbakedideas
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>This, combined with my <a href="/wiki/1bit">1bit</a> aesthetics, led me
to come up with this concept I'm calling "bitwrite".
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The main goal is to build a means for me to boostrap my way
into buildinng graphical user interfaces from my familiar
keyboard-driven workflow. The idea is to build things that
are a bit better than the TUIs you'd see made by ncurses,
but not as sophisticated as something like imGUI. I also
hope to give the system a simple core with a very flexible
C API. That way, bitwrite can be easily modified and
extended.
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>The whole process starts with the wonderfully simple Kilo
text editor, and porting it to a simple bitmap GUI via SDL
'and <a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>. Bitmap fonts will be baked in using
the xbm format.
</p>
<p>Kilo internally treats text internally as a set of rows.
Instead of writing to a text file, Kilo will be modified
to write to a <a href="/wiki/sqlite">SQLite database</a> as a kind
of file format. This is where Kilo stops
being a text editor, and starts becoming a text interface.
With any luck, this approach will allow for more
extendability of bitwrite, and also help <a href="/wiki/convergence">better integrate with my existing software </a>that also uses SQLite.
</p>
<p>A command language will be added. Hitting alt-enter on
the current line will allow the line to be evaluated by
this interpreter.
</p>
<p>Kilo structures things in terms of rows of text. Instead of
text, this concept of a row will be expanded to be a region
of pixels. A program interface will be written that allows a
row to be occupied and written to in any arbitrary way. Not
just text. The row height can be adjusted, but the width
will remain fixed.
</p>
<p>New programs can be save/loaded to the SQLite file.
</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-09 13:56:26</b>: how would this structure work in C? would it also still keep rows flat with hierarchy stored elsewhere? things to think about.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 13:55:10</b>: in org-mode, it is possible to notate headers that skip levels. Which isn't all the helpful. I think it's better to keep things all relative: nodes are responsible for knowing who they belong to.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 13:52:32</b>: maybe some other table that references the ids from the raw rows table. the row order will always be the same, it just either goes up or down a level.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 13:50:28</b>: the first big modification I see is changing the file format. Instead of text files, it's going to be a self-contained SQLite file. The path of least resistance here is to make a table to store each line with their position. Then somehow we add something on top of that that enforces hierarchy.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 13:48:00</b>: working with kilo kind of feels like working with a ball of clay. it's malleable, yet finite. prepared. kilo already is built a certain way, and to get it to do what I want it to do involves gradually adding modifications to it.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 13:25:27</b>: the hard part, as I see it, is trying to work that into the existing kilo code. I don't actually know fully how the kilo system works. it stores text in sequential rows. but how hard would it be for rows to become tree nodes with rows in them?
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 13:23:55</b>: I'm beginning to think that I want bitwrite to be about controlling a tree of collapsable (folding) text blocks that can also be evaluated as commands to modify the internal state of the tree.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 13:20:48</b>: lost but not forgotten. as things like (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>), (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>), and (<a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a>) are growing, the need for something like bitwrite is becoming more necessary.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-16 21:51:08</b>: Bitwrite still needs a good data structure. I've been thinking about a tree to mimic outliner programs like org-mode. Somehow getting the graph format like \!zet to work would be pretty dope though.
