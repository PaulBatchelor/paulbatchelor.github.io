<h2>create gest interface for wavetable morphing</h2>

<a id="7000478d"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#7000478d">#7000478d</a>.
</p>
<p>this would be an interface built in gest that would allow an instance of (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) to morph between wavetable states, in a similar fashion to what is being done with <a href="/sndkit/tract">tract</a> in monolith

<h2>embed minimp4 into monolith, and create mkmp4 command</h2>

<a id="b5d1258b"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#b5d1258b">#b5d1258b</a>.
</p>
<p>one of the very noteworthy things about minimp4, in addition to being small. is that it solves the sync issue I've been running into (I think this was a timestamp complaint)

<h2>add runt + scheme helpers to assist in making scheme/runt node hybrids</h2>

<a id="bb444acb"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#bb444acb">#bb444acb</a>.
</p>
<p>as I sit here writing a node wrapped in scheme/runt for <a href="/sndkit/vowel">vowel</a> (vowelmorph), I realize there's a lot of verbose code that should be abstracted away somehow.

<h2>import xmt and create proof-of concept</h2>

<a id="9a431ccf"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#9a431ccf">#9a431ccf</a>.
</p>
<p>xmt is a library I am reviving, which generates XM files. Import XMT into monolith, and create enough tooling to be able to generate instruments and patterns from scheme.

<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-08-23 20:45:09</b>: the notion of tiny media files is still intriguing to me. but the discrete nature of the XM format is something I am at odds at in this phase of my live. it's hard to be able to live with just the XM file format. hybridization with more continuous things in a modular setting and (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>) using something like <a href="/sndkit/phslk">phslk</a> absolutely. but by itself, not yet...
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-27 16:30:39</b>: a wrapper function for xmt should be able to copy over the sample data.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-27 16:30:00</b>: a convenient way to handle buffers is through ftables in soundpipe. make named ftables in monolith, then render to that buffer. have version that supply it in samples, seconds, or all.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-27 16:29:03</b>: rather than rewrite it to take in blocks, make a new function which renders the remaining block. this will guarantee that the buffer will start with a new patch rather than a few samples of the old one.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-27 16:27:15</b>: monolith_compute nearly works, except that it operates on samples rather than blocks.
</p>
<p><b>2021-05-27 16:26:52</b>: we will need an ability to render monolith patches to a buffer, and then copy that buffer into XMT.

<p><b>2021-03-18 14:08:43</b>: now that the mkimg command works better. will need to double check.
