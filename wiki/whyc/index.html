<title>Why C?</title>
<h1>Why C?</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"think of this as an intervention lol.
using c these days is like wearing bell bottom pants
(also a product of the 60's)."
</p>
<p>- Excerpt from a friends email to me, 2017
</p>
<p>As of writing, it's 2020, and I still happily write things
in C. ANSI C a lot of the time now, but occasionally a
subset of C99 C.
</p>
<p>Why C today? For me, it comes down to legacy and
portability. Two very important things that something like
computer needs to have. I believe software tools for
computer musicians need to be usable for many decades.
At the same time, the software you right should be portable
and flexible, ready to adapt to new platforms and hardware.
C is a reasonably safe choice for that.
</p>
<p><a href="/proj/soundpipe.html">Soundpipe</a> is a good example of
a program that thinks long-term. It's written in very
portable c99. In the 5 years that Soundpipe has existed,
it has been ported to all the major OS platforms (Linux, OS,
Windows), all the major mobile platforms (iOS, Android), the
web (via emscripten), several ARM bare-metal
platforms, and I've been told that it works on AmigaOS. This
is a testament to how portable well written C programs can
be.
</p>
<p>C is a conservative choice, and in the world of digital art,
I am one for conservation. The c99 and c89 specs are very
well established. We've had several decades to learn about
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior">things we forgot about</a>.
There are also a handful of C compiler implementations out
there. Admittedly, clang/gcc have become the only reliable
ones, but there are certainly others like tcc, pcc, and lcc.
This variety is good. New languages usually have an evolving
standard. With these sorts of languages, it can be hard to
say what parts will last, and what parts will stay. This
volatility is not great for long-term creative ecosystems.
One wants to build a tool, master it, then forget about it.
It's counter-productive to keep updating to the Latest and
Greatest (TM) software stack in order to make the thing
run still. Shell scripts, small Makefiles, and C compilers
will do the trick.
