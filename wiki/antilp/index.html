<title>Against literate programming</title>
<h1>Against literate programming</h1>
<p>Some genuine reasons to avoid this <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate programming</a> nonsense
altogether
</p>
<p>It takes time. In addition to typing code, now you have
to write stuff.
</p>
<p>Writing is hard. Coding is hard too, but it's easier to
stay employed as a bad coder than it is a bad writer.
</p>
<p>Code blocks encourage spaghetti code. Being able to
declare code out-of-order can quickly obfuscate
program flow.
</p>
<p>It can easily devolve into simple inline documentation.
The world already has enough of that thankyouverymuch.
</p>
<p>Collaboration is hard. I'm not saying it's impossible, but
think about how hard it is to collaborate on normal writing.
Now add programming and source control on top of all that.
By and large, it has historicaly been an extremely
solitary or oligarchical paradigm.
