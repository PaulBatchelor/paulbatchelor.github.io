<title>Monome Grid</title>
<h1>Monome Grid</h1>
<p>The grid is a grid controller made by
<a href="https://monome.org">monome</a>. It is <b>the</b> grid controller.
</p>
<p>The standard iteration is a 16x8 array of silicone
buttons. Each button has an LED which can be independently
turned on and off.
</p>
<p>Unlike many grid controllers, the Grid is designed from the
start to be programmable. By default, it doesn't do
anything. One must seek out programs designed interface with
the monome.
</p>
<p>Many Grid programs are written in MaxMSP or
supercollider. Using serialosc, one can write programs in
any language able to use the OSC.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the grid can be controlled more directly
using libmonome via a serial connection. See my
<a href="/wiki/grid_tutorial">grid_tutorial</a> for how to control a grid using
libmonome directly instead of OSC.
</p>
<p>Before monome started making other products,
the Grid was to as the Monome.
</p>
<p>From a design perspecitve. The Grid can be thought of as
a low-resolution monochrome touchscreen with extremely high
accuracy.
