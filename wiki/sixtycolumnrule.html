<h1>Sixty Column Ruley</h1>
<p>A take on the classic 80 column rule, the 60 column rule
is a coding guidline which states that a line of code should
not exceed more than 60 characters. It is an experimental
rule that I am currently enforcing with all my more recent
programming project.
</p>
<p>My initial motivation for trying out such a crazy idea came
after acquiring a <a href="/wiki/gpd_pocket_2.html">GPD Pocket 2</a>,
which only has a 7 inch screen. While using the device, I
found myself wanting to use larger beefier fonts for easier
readability. When dialing in comfortable settings, the total
line width of the screen ended up being around 70
characters, less than the desirable 80 characters. So, I
decided to see what it would be like to code with 60 column
rule. 60 is large enough to be functional, but small enough
to force noticeable changes in workflow.
</p>
<p>My interest is in seeing how using the 60 column rule
changes my coding style and programming behavior.
