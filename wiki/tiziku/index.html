<p>Tiziku (2016, 2020) is a generative audio-visual work.

</p>
<p>Orignally written in Spring 2016 as a final project for the
220b algorithmic composition class at CCRMA. It was revisted
in early 2020 and refactored to generate offline video.
</p>
<p>Inspiration:
</p>
<p>Visual: Rothko (what little I knew of them at the time), and
my bathroom light in my apartment at the time.
</p>
<p>Lots of rectangles, and limited color pallettes. I used the term
"breathing Rothko" at the time to describe what I was done.
</p>
<p>Audio:
</p>
<p>Most of the patch is 26 lines of Sporth code.
</p>
<p>Components:
</p>
<p>Samples of an orchestra tuning up. Two mincers scrub through
this sample.
</p>
<p>FM keyboard patch. Plays a fixed melody. There's a fixed
melody sequence and a fixed rhythmic sequence in prop. They
are different sizes (7 + 6), so they good.
</p>
<p>White noise, gets triggered every time the Rothko
"breathes". Meant to evoke the feeling of breathing.
</p>
<p>The spice on top are the "glitches". These are generated in
ChucK: implulses put through the LPF ugen (resonant lowpass
filter). Visually, glitches make the individual rectangles
onscreen to blink on and off. Sometimes the squares blink
and stay off, which cause holes of empty space to happen.
</p>
<p>The original 2016 codebase was very fragile.
I only managed to get it running on two of my computers,
only one of which I still have. At the time, I wanted to
experiment with using many domain-specific languages at
once. There were many moving parts:
</p>
<p>A hacked version of ChucK (included with the codebase),
designed to run in my own JACK render loop.
</p>
<p>Sporth, run inside of ChucK via <a href="/proj/chorth.html">Chorth</a>.
</p>
<p>NanoVG for 2d grahics, run inside of the GLFW OpenGL
wrapper.
</p>
<p>A lua scripting component for the drawing routines.
</p>
<p>Four years later in 2020, I decided to perform some
compositional necromancy and bring this sucker back to life.
This required completely rewriting the engine backend:
</p>
<p>The ChucK components were removed entirely. The timing
behavior and DSP for the glitches were re-implemented in C.
</p>
<p>Cairo replaced NanoVG for antialiased 2d graphics.
</p>
<p>Instead of OpenGL/GLFW for realtime graphics, offline
h264 video was generated using libx264.
</p>
<p>Sporth was replaced with... Sporth! This code was taken
out of ChucK and pretty much worked without modification.
I made the Sporth component run inside of a
<a href="/proj/patchwerk">patchwerk</a> node.
</p>
<p>The lua code pretty much worked without any modification. I
just had to rewrite the underlying wrapped C functions to
use Cairo instead of NanoVG. I ended up using a local copy
of lua 5.3 in ANSI C mode.
</p>
<p>The Tiziku program when run now generates a video file and
an audio file which can be stitched together into an mp4
using the FFMPEG tool. Rather than let FFMPEG encode the WAV
audio, I opted to manually convert it to mp3 in LAME.
