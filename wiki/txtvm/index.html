<h1>txtvm</h1>
<p>A potential idea for an toy VM with a plain text
bytecode system.
</p>
<p>Inspired by a <a href="/wiki/halfbaked">half baked idea</a>:
</p>
<p><blockquote>
<b>2020-07-28 12:24:00:</b> the idea would be to build and share tiny 6.5 bit programs encoded as printable ascii characters. this could then in turn be read by a virtual computer to do things like paint a picture or compose a piece of music. #halfbakedideas

</p>
<p>How does one share digital art in a low bandwidth kind of
way? <code>txtvm</code> tries to answer this a fun hacker way.
</p>
<p>Instead of trying to use fancy compression algorithms,
express the work as a program small enough to fit inside of
a toot, tweet, or <a href="/wiki/twtxt">twtxt</a> post.
</p>
<p>The program can be downloaded and read by a specialized
interpreter. The interpreter holds all the complexity and
is able then render the results.
</p>
<p>So, a big part of this system is coming up with a
serialiazation format. Because it is limited to printable
ascii, it would be a 6-bit serialization format. Perhaps
loosely based on <a href="#">msgpack</a> and <a href="#">bare</a>.
</p>
<p>The language itself would be a simple
<a href="/wiki/stack_based">stack-based VM</a>, with
words being represented as integer values to save space.
Programs in txtvm themselves would probably be
meta-programmed using high-level languages like
<a href="/wiki/janet">janet</a> or <a href="/wiki/scheme">scheme</a>.
</p>
<p>A VM like this would place heavy emphasis on custom bytecode
interpreters, treating the bytecode as more of a low-level
domain specific language. One interpreter could be something
geared for controlling a synthesizer. Another could be made
for drawing pictures. Each interpreter would have their own
dictionary of low-level primitives to choose from, and the
bytecode would be designed to run on the agreed upon system.
