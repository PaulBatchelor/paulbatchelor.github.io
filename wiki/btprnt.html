<h1>BTPRNT</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

"btprnt", or "bitprint", or "bitmap printer", is a
(currently hypothetical) library for generating monochrome
bitmap graphics.

<h2>Why?</h2>

BTPRNT will be used to generate information charts and mind
maps, as well as musical scores. I can imagine these being
used in "postcard form" to give summaries of some projects
and ideas.
<br>
The codebase will be designed to be simple and portable.
<br>
Aesthetic is another important aspect as well. I like the
sharpness of monochrome pixel art. It reminds me of the
elegence seen on the old macintosh computers.
<br>
One feature that I am hoping to implement is the idea of
an infinite canvas. This is something I feel like I am
missing in my toolset.
