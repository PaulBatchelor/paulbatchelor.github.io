<title>Cider Vinegar Beverage</title>
<h1>Cider Vinegar Beverage</h1>

<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Some time in late 2022 or early 2023, I discovered
a Cider Vinegar sparkling beverage they were selling and
it was delicious. However, it seemed quite expensive,
considering you could only buy 4 at a time in small
red-bull sized aluminum cans. So, I decided to try and make
my own. Just a few aisles over, there was a bottle of
raw apple cider vinegar. And it just developed from here.
</p>
<p>At the time of writing (january 2024), this page hopes to
provide a loose outline for the drink I've concocted. This
is the sort of recipe to be interpretted, not followed.
Improvisation is encourage.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, a cider vinegar beverage has 3 parts:
the cider vinegar, the sweetener, and the flavoring.
Controlling the proportions is a matter of taste. I have
settled on a 4:6:3 ratio for cider:sweeteners:flavoring.
</p>
<p>A good tasting cider vinegar is important. Find something
that is natural and organic. Heinz is too sterile tasting.
I've been using Braggs for a while now, and I highly
recommend it.
</p>
<p>Sweeteners are typically something like grape juice
and apple juice. They are sweet and have a general "neutral"
flavor to them. These don't really have much personality,
and really only act to balance out the bite of the cider
vinegar.
</p>
<p>Flavoring is often a juice that adds distinction to the
drink. My favorite is this blueberry blackberry acai juice
blend I've found in the supermarket. I've used tart cherry
juice in the past and that's quite good as well.
</p>
<p>Flavoring can also include spices and extracts. I've used
ginger, both powdered and fresh (fresh is better obviously).
A dash of orange extract adds some good fragrance as
well (something like orange bitters I imagine would be an
interesting thing to experiment with, though I haven't
tried this yet). Finally, there's Jam (yes, Jam.) I've
mixed in an organic strawberry jam and it is both a good
sweetner and flavoring.
</p>
<p>A typical batch of juice concentrate tends to look
like this for me:
</p>
<p>200 grams apple cider vinegar
150 grams apple juice (sweetener)
150 grams grape juice (sweetener)
150 grams blueberry blackberry acai juice (flavoring)
(optional) ~1.5 tablespoons strawberry jam (flavoring)
(optional) grated fresh ginger (flavoring)
(optional) orange extract (flavoring)
</p>
</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>If you're not using jam, the ingredients can be mixed
together in one go.
</p>
<p>If you're using jam, you'll want
to make sure the Jam is dissolved in the mixed liquids by
heating it on the stove. Throw in the ginger as well
and bring to a brief boil.
</p>
<p>The juice mixture created is a concentrated meant to be
mixed with cold water, either still or sparkling. For
carbonated water, I use a sodastream to make the sparkling
water. For a single glass, I mix 60 grams of concentrate
with a about 120-135 grams water. Add in a dash of orange
extract. For non-sparkling still water, I often find myself
adding a little more concentrate to make it taste a little
less watery.
