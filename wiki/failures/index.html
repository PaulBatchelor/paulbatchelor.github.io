<title>Failures</title>
<h1>Failures</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A curated selection of some projects I've done that
are failures for one reason or another.
</p>
<p>Failures happen when I try out an idea, and it doesn't
work out. This is a very familiar thing for me. Luckily,
there has yet to be a failure for me that has been a net
negative. Nearly always there is something to learn from.
</p>

<h2>Failures in Monolith</h2>

<p><a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a> is full of bad ideas, so this is an
easy one to start with. I throw a lot of things in that
project to see what sticks. In particular, the many
<a href="/proj/monolith/wiki/pages">pages</a> that I have made for it.
</p>

<h3>line16</h3>

<p><a href="/proj/monolith/wiki/line16">line16</a> was a line sequencer I made for
monome and arc that could produce curves and lines to use
as control signals in patches. This ended being difficult
to use in musically settings. Because the line durations
where all managed internally, it was very difficult to make
this program "play well" with others. I also made it so
the input values were all normalized intensities, seemed
great and made a lot of sense for the interface, but that
backfired.
</p>
<p>Line16 was a very ambitious page in Monolith to make, full
of animation challenges that I had to think about and solve.
Line16 was a great step in the right direction for me with
my thoughts about gesture and continuous control, and helped
give me insight into a <a href="/wiki/gest">new line sequencer I am attempting to build.</a>.
</p>

<h3>trig</h3>

<p><a href="/proj/monolith/wiki/trig">trig</a> is/was a rhythmic computer. The
idea is basically build a clock signal generator that was
a toy VM, programmable via the grid interface.
</p>
<p>Cool concept in theory, except the intersection between
what is interesting for a programmer and what is interesting
musically is very small. I'm hoping I can make more of
an interesting connection at some point, but I've been
underwhelmed by the results so far.
</p>

<h2>Failures in Sporth</h2>


<h3>Sporth In General</h3>

<p>I've outgrown Sporth. This is hard for me to say because
of how much time and effort I put into it, but I have. It
didn't work too great on mobile, and you couldn't easily
extend the language without recompiling the entire codebase.
</p>
<p>So! I got to work trying to re-imagine something a little
bit better. I first started by separating the underlying
engine with the language more. This new engine would be
called <a href="/wiki/patchwerk">patchwerk</a>. And since I already
happened to have a <a href="/wiki/runt">general-purpose stack based language</a> lying around,
it was trivial to merge the two together to make something
very Sporth-y, while being more efficient and flexible.
</p>

<h3>Prop</h3>

<p><a href="/proj/prop.html">prop</a> was a proportional rhythmic
notation system I wrote that would produce trigger signals.
I made two implementations of it, one of which lies in
Soundpipe (mostly to be used in Sporth).
</p>
<p>The big issue it has is that it uses it's own internal
timing, which means inevitable clock drift if it tries
to play with others. This inability to interact with
other things stunted the growth right there.
</p>
<p>Prop ended up being very musically satisfying to use,
so my hope is to one day re-explore these ideas. Maybe
in <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>? That's the plan for now, at least.
</p>

<h3>Lsys</h3>

<p><a href="/proj/lsys">lsys</a> was an rhythmic L-system
notation language I wrote inside of Sporth. It turns out
generating rhythmic sequences from L-Systems aren't as
interesting as I hoped they'd be.
</p>
<p>The lesson I learned here is: don't let your eyes trick your
ears. There are a lot of very interesting things in computer
graphics that look flashy and cool in the visual domain, that
end up being lackluster when translated to the audio domain.
</p>

<h3>PolySporth</h3>

<p><a href="/proj/polysporth">polysporth</a> was a weird attempt at
getting polyphony in Sporth, using
Scheme. It wasn't fully thought out, and it just ended up
being a mess. I did get quite familiar with s7 scheme, then
tinyscheme. I also learned not to underestimate the
difficulties of polyphony. And as it so happens, I realized
that getting polyphony working in sporth wasn't worth
the trouble.
</p>

<h3>Spigot</h3>

<p><a href="/proj/spigot">Spigot</a> was a set of GUI interfaces I wrote
to control Sporth. These
failed with the classic issue of too small to be useful
with no room for growth.
</p>

<h2>Libline</h2>

<p><a href="/proj/libline">libline</a> was my first attempt at building
a library for generating audio-rate line segments
for use in automation curves. Similar to <a href="/proj/prop.html">prop</a>,
libline managed time internally and had clock drift issues which
made things fall out of sync very quickly.
</p>
<p>Steps in the right direction, and like Prop, something
I hope to explore more in <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>.
</p>

<h2>Voc</h2>

<p>I spent some time porting <a href="https://dood.al/pinktrombone/">Pink Trombone</a> to
ANSI C in a project called <a href="/wiki/voc">voc</a>.
I was pleased with the sounding results, and I even
managed to grok some of how Pink Trombone worked. But this
was my first <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate program</a>.
The literate style only made things more confusing to read,
not less. Had I done things differently, I would have tried
porting it all to C first before adapting it as a literate
program.
</p>
<p>I'm hoping to take a second stab at this at some point. But
for now, I've taken small stabs by porting portions of Voc
into <a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a> components <a href="/sndkit/tract">tract</a> and
<a href="/sndkit/glottis">glottis</a>.
</p>

<h2>Runt</h2>

<p><a href="/wiki/runt">Runt</a> set out to do one thing, failed,
and now is being used for something else. More words later.
</p>

<h2>Protrekkr</h2>

<p>I really thought I could polish up the codebase to
<a href="/proj/protrekkr">Protrekkr</a> and make it the music tracker
of my dreams. But holy crap, this code base is a lost cause.
After months and months of persistant refactoring, I finally
gave up. This taught me that some things just can't be saved,
no matter how good they look (and I still love how protrekkr
looks).
</p>

<h2>Failed Proposals</h2>

<p>Okay, I've recently talked so much about this that this is
whining now. But this <a href="/wiki/CATFMAS">PhD project Proposal</a> got rejected. However, this has
proven to be a <b>tremendously</b> helpful exercise to do, and
I'm grateful about the process.
</p>

<h2>More Thoughts On Failures</h2>

<p>Messages from my <a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a> linked to the
<code>failure</code> group.

<p><blockquote>
<b>2021-07-09 11:02:01</b>: Creating a new (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) group for myself #failure. Will be amalgamated in the new (<a href="/wiki/failures">failures</a>) page.
