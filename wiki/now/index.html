<h1>Now</h1>
<p>My little <code>now</code> page.
</p>
<p>Here's what I am doing/working on as of November 26th,
2022.
</p>
<p>I am now employed. I have also moved.
</p>
<p>Deep in thought about the notion
of <a href="/wiki/gesture">Gesture</a> as it relates to sound
and music. Both the concept, as well as
the <a href="/wiki/gesture_signal_generator">algorithm I've developed</a> with the same name.
</p>
<p>I am working on a new
set of etudes and writings called Gestlings, which will
feature patches controlled via <a href="/wiki/gestvm">gestvm</a>, the
successor to <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>. Nothing too public yet.
</p>
<p>I've always wanted the <a href="/wiki/grid">Grid</a> to have a larger role
in the work I do. Systems like <a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a> were
built with Grid use in mind. Planning out yet another attempt
to make this happen.
</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/mnolth">mnolth</a> project is the quiet successor
to <a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>. It contains several projects of
mine lumped together in one place, such as <a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>,
<a href="/wiki/gestvm">gestvm</a>, <a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>, and <a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a>.
There's also some initial live coding capabilities. Work on
this will be limited to my current gesture projects.
</p>
<p>Singing synthesis research is still happening, though I've
broadened my scope to the general concept of computer
performed lyricism in music.
</p>
<p>Lots and lots of ink and paper.
