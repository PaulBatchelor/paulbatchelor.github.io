<h1>Now</h1>
<p>My little <code>now</code> page.
</p>
<p>Here's what I am doing/working on as of June 29th, 2021:
</p>
<p>Both <a href="/sndkit/glottis">glottis</a> and <a href="/sndkit/tract">tract</a>have been added to , thus recycling 90%
of my abandoned project <a href="/wiki/voc">voc</a>.
</p>
<p>I also added some bandlimited oscillators to
sndkit: <a href="/sndkit/blep">blep</a>. Hoping to spend some time
adding a few more things in the weeks to come. See
<a href="/wiki/sndkit_TODO">what's in store!</a>.
</p>
<p>I've got quite a few words written down for <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>,
which will serve as the basis for a <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate program</a>, written using
<a href="/wiki/worgle">worgle</a>. Initial code should be happening soon.
</p>
<p>My focus on gesture will bleed into my <a href="/wiki/codex">Transmissions for the Candy Crystal Rainbow Codex</a>.
Specifically, I want to use gestures to produce lyrical
singing things.
</p>
<p>Trying to write more <a href="/wiki/breathing_cards">Breathing Cards</a>.
</p>
<p>Finally diving into Ge Wang's "Artful Design: A musicomic
manifesto", and I couldn't have picked a better
time to start reading it, as it resonates
with my <a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">own recent thoughts on toy making</a>.
</p>
<p>SDFs are still neat. I want to build a C library that deals
with 2d SDFs for generative art. Do SDFs work with
raytracers? Rereading Peter Shirley's Raytracing in One
Weekend, which has now become a CC0 work!
</p>
<p>Testing out my new meditation bench in my floor setup
as a more portable replacement for my Zafu/Zabuton.
Ouch my feet.
