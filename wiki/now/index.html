<h1>Now</h1>
<p>My little <code>now</code> page.
</p>
<p>Here's what I am doing/working on as of October 25th, 2021:
</p>
<p>October has been a month doing <a href="/wiki/looptober_2021">looptober</a>. I've been using it as an opportunity to
try out my <a href="/wiki/gest">gesture synthesizer</a> with
some of my vocal synthesizer components <a href="/sndkit/tract">tract</a> and <a href="/sndkit/voc">voc</a>.
</p>
<p>Thinking about Rust and Audio DSP, and porting some
of my algorithms to that language.
I have no plans on abandoning <a href="/wiki/whyc">the C programming language</a> for projects like <a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>. But I'd like to see how the rest of the world
lives, and perhaps think about this landscape in the
future?
</p>
<p>Getting back into wavetable synthesis and FM. The missing
link was <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>, which now allows me to morph
between waveforms in any arbitrary size and number.
Implementing a 4-operater FM patch for <a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>with morphing capabilities seems inevitable.
</p>
<p>In general, lots of time, thought, and energy spent on
<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>, as well as thinking about <a href="/wiki/gesture">gesture</a> as a general concept.
</p>
<p>Working on a new blog series: Synthwave From Scratch. I
made a synthwave track using <a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a> and
<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>, and I want to talk about how it was made.
</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a> feels stalled.
</p>
<p>Applying to jobs. Feeling <a href="#">failure</a></p>
