<h1>Now</h1>
<p>My little <code>now</code> page.
</p>
<p>Here's what I am doing/working on as of April 15th,
2022.
</p>
<p>Lots and lots of <a href="/brain">reading and studying</a>. Hoping
to improve some tech skills of mine and generally be
more employable.  Recently completed the first 6 chapters
of computer systems: a programmers perspecitve. Working
my way now through the first half of The Algorithm Design
Manual.
</p>
<p>The new 7-inch eink setup works pretty well. I enjoy
less glare in my life. Eink Lifespan and
the screen's durability are my concerns.
</p>
<p>Getting back into doodling notes in a moleskin with a grid.
New pens are fun. Pen and paper is a very good medium for
storing (as well as enabling) creative thought.
</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/arduboy">arduboy</a> toy game I was working on ended
up being more troubel than it's worth. I'm not giving up
on the medium entirely, but putting it aside.
</p>
<p>Trying to think more about <a href="/wiki/1bit">1-bit</a> art.
In particular things that can be animated and/or
interactive.
</p>
<p>Studying Perry cook's waveguide model, which was
implemented in Gnuspeech. Hoping to make my own flavor,
controlled via gesture.
</p>
<p>In general, thinking more about game design. I've started
dipping my toe into Godot a little bit, and I'm trying
to embrace the modern Web (browser) as a convenient
distribution medium.
</p>
<p>Listening to a lot of Palestrina.</p>
