<h1>Now</h1>
<p>My little <code>now</code> page.
</p>
<p>Here's what I am doing/working on as of July 7th, 2021:
</p>
<p>Some very very initial code structure for <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>.
Nothing works. Nothing has been tested.
</p>
<p>Have not written any more <a href="/wiki/breathing_cards">Breathing Cards</a>. The Breathing Cards series exists
to test out new things. New things for me include
<a href="/sndkit/blep">blep</a>, <a href="/sndkit/tract">tract</a>, and
<a href="/sndkit/glottis">glottis</a>. I also made a port of Verbity
from Airwindows a while back. DSP isn't the issue now
though, it's control. Hence, my interest in <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>.
</p>
<p>The <a href="/codex">codex</a> still needs to be fed, but I'm working
on some new design systems and sounds for it. I'm
hoping to utilize <a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a> with <a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>.
And yes! I'm attemtping to swim back to kuf, my generative
square kufic project.
</p>
<p>Still reading: Ge Wang's "Artful Design: A musicomic
manifesto".
</p>
<p>Thinking about making a wiki page on various failed or
disappointing projects of mine. Why they failed, and
what I learned.
</p>
<p>Thinking about implicit music, this idea that music naturally
exudes from everything everywhere, and thinking about just
music by itself is too much tunnel vision.
</p>
<p>Thinking about building
musical experiences that involve farming, growth, and
caretaking of virtual musical creatures with personality
that socialize with one another. All of these would make
music implicitly.
</p>
<p>Thinking about making a new grid/arc driven page for
<a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>, specifically designed to interactively
shape a vocal tract using <a href="/sndkit/tract">tract</a>. The idea
here would be to build up and store different target shapes
to interpolate between in another later context.
