<h1>Now</h1>
<p>My little <code>now</code> page.
</p>
<p>Here's what I am doing/working on as of March 18, 2022.
</p>
<p>Still unemployed. Job hunting. Thinking about what to do
next with my career.
</p>
<p>Switched back to Vim from emacs. Mostly painless
transition, though my live coding setup needs to be
reworked (<a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a> is probably abandoned now?).
</p>
<p>I got an tiny 7-inch e-ink display! It's the same size as
the tiny display I've been using, and it works well
with my personal computing workflow.
</p>
<p>Created initial wiki page for <a href="/wiki/mnolth">mnolth</a>. Mnolth
should be starting it's own wiki soon.
</p>
<p>Developed <a href="/wiki/gestvm">gestvm</a>, a gesture
synthesizer/sequencer similar to <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>, only
controlled via <a href="/wiki/uxn">uxn</a>, and implemented using
a more generalized <a href="/sndkit/rephasor">rephasor</a>, rather
than the ramptree structure. Should enable gestures
that are more procedurally generated.
</p>
<p>Getting back into the <a href="/wiki/arduboy">arduboy</a>. The goal is
to make a small and silly game.
</p>
<p>More singing synthesis research, behind the scenes, but
it's passive. Big questions: how to do get fricatives? and
how to more easily find tract shapes? Research and study
around that.
