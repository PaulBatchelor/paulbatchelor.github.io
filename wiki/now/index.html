<h1>Now</h1>
<p>My little <code>now</code> page.
</p>
<p>Here's what I am doing/working on as of November 6th, 2021:
</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/looptober_2021">Looptober</a> is over, now it's
time for <a href="/wiki/novembeat_2021">novembeat_2021</a>.
</p>
<p>Working on a new blog series: <a href="/wiki/synthwave_from_scratch">Synthwave From Scratch</a>. Hoping
to have at least the first 2 or 3 parts done this month. We
shall see.
</p>
<p>Thanks to Novembeat, I'm thinking more seriously about
<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample curation</a>, and am
actively improving the tools surrounding that, including
<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a> and <a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>. I have a notion to
begin publishing the static wiki component of my sample
library zettelkasten.
</p>
<p>Looking into making improvements to my singing synthesizer,
as I started hitting creative walls with the current iteration
during <a href="/wiki/looptober_2021">looptober_2021</a>. Things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_palate">Velum</a> will
be easy to add from <a href="#">Voc</a>, but I will
also be looking into how to do more things related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fricative">Fricatives</a>.
The big thing here is synchronized control, which I am
currently doing via <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>. These added components
may add more complexity.
</p>
<p>Might make a singing synthesizer based on Klatt Synthesis
controllable by <a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>. Should be a great deal
more efficient, which would allow it to run on underpowered
devices, which falls in line more with
my <a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">toys_not_tools</a> mantra.</p>
