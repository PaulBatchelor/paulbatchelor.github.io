<h1>Giblang</h1>
<p>This is a little script I use to generate asemic titles and
names for the things I work on. It is notably used to
generate titles for my <a href="/wiki/breathing_cards">BreathingCards</a>.
</p>
<p>The main idea is to build up words one syllable at a time.
A syllable is a random pairing of a consonant sound and a
vowel sound.
