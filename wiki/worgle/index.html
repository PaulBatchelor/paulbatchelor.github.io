<h1>Worgle</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Worgle is a fast and portable tangler for programs written
in a limited subset of <a href="https://orgmode.org">org</a>, which
includes noweb-style expansion for literate programming.
</p>
<p>The source code can be
<a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/worgle">found on github.</a></p>
<br>
<p>I wrote Worgle as a follow-up to my initial experiences
with
<a href="/blog/posts/2018-09-21-org-babel-impressions.html">literate programming using org-mode</a> While org and org-mode have
the potential to be great modern-day tools for
Knuthian-style literate programming, I found their current
implementations to be inferior to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWEB">CWEB</a> Tangling
org-code with emacs is painfully slow, to the point of
being unusable. Tangled C/C++ code does not export
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Line-Control.html">line declaration macros</a>, making debugging a terribly
impractical experience.
</p>
<p>Worgle is written in itself, and is bootstrapped using a
minimalist ANSI C org tangler called Orgle.
</p>
<p>In addition to tangling code, some initially steps have
been taken to produce an HTML exporter, a process
classically referred to as <b>weaving</b> code. This weaver,
called Sorg, is also written in ANSI C using Worgle. While
incomplete, it is quite usable. Examples of Sorg being used
to generate HTML have been posted for
<a href="/res/worgle/sorg_toc.html">Sorg</a> and
<a href="/res/worgle/worgle_toc.html">Worgle</a>. In order to match
the CSS of this website, these pages with sorg via a
<a href="/res/worgle/mkpage.html">shell script</a>.

<h2>TODO A 5 minute introduction</h2>

<p>A fly-by tutorial for how to use Worgle.
</p>
<p>Will get to this soon!
</p>

<h2>Bootstrapping Process</h2>

<p>Worgle is itself a literate program written in Org, and can
be tangled using itself. To do this, a bootstrapping process
is derived.
</p>
<p>First, a very primitive org tangler witten in ANSI C called
orgle is compiled. This is written as a C file and does not
need to be tangled.
</p>
<p>Orgle is then used to create worglite, a limited version of
worgle that is somewhere in between orgle and worgle. This
is done by tangling <code>worgle.org</code> with orgle, and then
compiling it with <code>-DWORGLITE</code>. The main <code>worgle.org</code> is
written in such a way that it can be parsed and compiled
by itself with the original orgle program.
</p>
<p>Finally, worglite is used to retangle worgle into the full
version, where it can then be compiled into worgle. From
there, all extra tools/components can use the full Worgle
tangler.
</p>

<h2>TODO Org Subset</h2>

<p>To keep the implementation lightweight, worgle uses
a small subset of Org code.
</p>
<p>Will write more on this later.</p>
