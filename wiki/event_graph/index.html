<title>Event Graphs</title>
<h1>Event Graphs</h1>
<p>A part of patchwerk, event graphs are a means of
representing discrete temporal events. Discrete
events are represented as nodes, and are connected
to one another through time durations.
</p>
<p>Event graphs are designed to be a balanced counter-part
to the patchwerk audio graph.
</p>

<h3>Why the Graph?</h3>

<p>In computer music, the graph (informally known as a "patch"
in modular synth communities), is an extremly powerful
structure for describing sound, and is the basis for
patchwerk. It is incredibly useful tool for building complex
self-evolving works that have seemingly organic feel to
them.
</p>
<p>The idea behind the event graph was to take this structure
primarily used for representing signal flow, and apply it
to events in time. The hope is that this structure would
help in the realization of beautifully complex
non-linear and probablistic macro structures in music.
</p>

<h3>What is an event?</h3>

<p>An "event" is a generalized version of a note. A thing that
happens at a discrete point in time.
</p>
<p>When I first began really trying to use Sporth, I quickly
found the design of the language incapable of seemingly
simple things. I couldn't really play "marry had a little
lamb" with it. It quickly became clear that beyond
envelope generators and clocks, Sporth really didn't have
a true concept of a "note", and that an interface would need
to be on top of it. Cue Polysporth, and months of my life
that I would never get back.
</p>

<h3>Okay, but why the event graph?</h3>

<p>Because linear sequencing is boring. Or maybe it's just
that I always end up with boring things with linear
sequencing (somewhere there's an old soundcloud of mine that
proves this).
</p>
<p>It can be a very long tedious process to sequence something.
When you are done, you get something that sounds exactly the
same every time you play it.
</p>
<p>One of the many things that fascinate me about working in
modular environments is how the sounds grow and evolve with
you as you are changing it. Graphs can get so complex that
one tiny change ends up completly transforming the entire
character of the piece. It is a much more rewarding +
organic process than anything that can be done in a
skeumorphic DAW.
</p>

<h3>Event Node Concepts</h3>


<h4>Delta Cables</h4>

<p>Imagine each "event" as being a node. Every event
node points to another event node. Each event node
has a "tail", known as a delta cale, which says how long to
way until going to the next event node. The event duration
are in whole-integer time units, as the event graph uses an
audio-rate clock signal.
</p>
<p>A delta-cable that has a delta time of 0 will immediatly go
to the next node. Stacking zero-duration nodes up allows
multiple events to occur at a single point.
</p>

<h4>Terminal Nodes</h4>

<p>An event node that points to a null value is considered
to be a terminal node, meaning the event graph will go
to a halt.
</p>

<h4>Switch Nodes</h4>

<p>When called, a switch node will alternate between two event
nodes before returning the next event node. If the next
event node is itself, it will simply alternate between
two event nodes.
</p>

<h4>Cointoss Nodes</h4>

<p>Like the switch node, except that the node will randomly
choose either of nodes.
</p>

<h4>Parametric Switch</h4>

<p>A parametric switch is an event switch whose output can be
controlled by an external value, presumably and audio-rate
patchwerk cable.
</p>

<h4>Triplet Nodes</h4>

<p>Like a switch, except with a group of three nodes.
</p>

<h4>Triptoss</h4>

<p>Like a cointoss, but with three.
</p>

<h4>Delta Modifier</h4>

<p>An event node that can change the delta cable of another
event node.
</p>

<h4>Chain</h4>

<p>A "chain" is a linear sequence of events, one after the
other.
</p>

<h4>Loop</h4>

<p>A loop is a sequence of events whose last event(s) return
or partially return to a defined top node.
</p>

<h4>Walker</h4>

<p>A walker is the thing that actually steps through an
event graph, given a starting node.
</p>

<h4>Walker List</h4>

<p>A walker list is a list of one or more walkers that are
run at the same time. Multiple walkers are ideal for
polyrhythmic or contrapuntal lines.
</p>

<h4>Metawalker</h4>

<p>A metawalker is a walker list embedded inside of an event
node. This is highly ideal for more complex sequences where
a variable number of concurrent walkers are needed at
any given point in time.
