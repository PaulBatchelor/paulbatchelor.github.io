<title>Planck</title>
<h1>Planck</h1>
<p>The planck is an ortholinear 4x12 mechancial keyboard.
</p>
<p>The original planck by Jack Humbert can be ordered at <a href="https://olkb.com">https://olkb.com</a>,
though <a href="https://drop.com">Drop (formerly Massdrop)</a> will occasionally manufacture them.
</p>
<p>The main community for OLKBs can be found on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/olkb">/r/olkb</a>.
</p>
<p>The main parts of an OLKB consist of the PCB, case,
top plate, switches, and keycaps. Switches + keycaps are the
most user-customizable, though there are some options for
cases in both form factor (mid-pro, hi-pro, lo-pro, eotw)
and color. PCBs are pretty much a set thing, with the only
difference being board versions, and can be programmed using
<a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK firmware</a>.
</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I own 3 planck keyboards which I
rotate through on a weekly basis. 2 of the 3 use
<a href="https://www.mechanicalkeyboards.com/switches/index.php?switch=Cherry-MX-Tactile-Grey">cherry mx tactile grey switches</a>, and the
other use <a href="https://www.mechanicalkeyboards.com/switches/index.php?switch=Cherry-MX-Brown">Cherry MX Brown Switches</a>.
</p>
<p>All my keycaps are blank row 3 SA profile switches. One is a
white PBT plastic, one is black ABS plastic, and the other
is green ABS plastic.</p>
