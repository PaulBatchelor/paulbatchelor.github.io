<title>toys not tools</title>
<h1>toys not tools</h1>
<p>"toys not tools" is my 2021 mantra. In my <a href="/wiki/create">creative life</a>, I tend to sink a lot
of time into <a href="/wiki/music_software_ecosystem">making tools for myself</a>, and it has come to point
where it's become this black hole of productivity. Tools
for the sake of tools. It's a form of procrastination that
has become a fruitless pursuit.
</p>
<p>You can see my progress <a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools_TODO">here</a>, where I have made a <a href="/wiki/TODO">TODO page for myself</a>. Hopefully, it will be full
of tasks and chatter.
</p>
<p>Toys, on the other hand, are an interesting new challenge.
First of all, Toys have an accessible narrative. Unlike
my usual esoteric computer music works, the
whimsical nature of toys can speak to a large audience.
It'd be nice to try communicate some ideas of mine to a
"normal" crowd while still maintaining some artistic
integrity.
</p>
<p>Toy design is small and clever. They are
tightly scoped in function, and usually are manufactured to
be mass produced. I mostly write software, so this last
point isn't as relevant, but the idea of building small
and constrained things has always intrigued me and can be
found in many of my pre-existing works.

<p><b>2021-08-23 20:19:17</b>: make vocal tract models work on the Daisy
</p>
<p><b>2021-07-24 16:22:15</b>: (<a href="/wiki/grid_tutorial">grid_tutorial</a>) is a rough draft for using the monome grid with C, similar to how it is done with (<a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-06-24 09:40:32</b>: SDFs are pretty neat. I've been very intrigued by 2d SDFs, and how they can be used to describe very organic forms. I really want to build anthropomorphic things like faces/mouths and make them sing/talk/blink/stare.
</p>
<p><b>2021-06-19 10:59:51</b>: I made a singing thing for #android called (<a href="/wiki/vocshape">vocshape</a>). I don't plan on doing much more with it.
</p>
<p><b>2021-03-25 15:00:35</b>: something I've been musing over today is the notion of 'overpowered toys'. toys that have no right being as useful as they are. maybe this is just tools with whimsical branding?
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 10:06:58</b>: I need to make android apps again. Publically this time. They were so much fun for me.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-09 10:05:27</b>: added a TODO for (<a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">toys_not_tools</a>): (<a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools_TODO">toys_not_tools_TODO</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-02 10:50:21</b>: created a (<a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">toys_not_tools</a>) page
