<title>The Magic Music Box Fallacy</title>
<h1>The Magic Music Box Fallacy</h1>
<p>The Magic Music Box is an concept I find myself using quite
a bit anytime I talk about misconceptions that arise
from computer-generated music.
</p>
<p>A Magic Music Box generally refers to any computer program
that generates an endless stream of music, usually with a
few input parameters ("genre" or "style" is usually amongst
them).
</p>
<p>It's an innocent sounding idea at first, which what makes it
so dangerous. It's a common trope one sees in CS students
with a music minor. Perhaps you took a music theory class
a while back, and learned a thing or two about counterpoint
and harmony. Perhaps you find yourself frustrated that pop
music has the same chord progression in every song. Surely,
one could write a program that follows these rules without
too much issue.
</p>
<p>For the Suits, what they see in the Magic Music Box problem
is a way to automate content creation, a common bottleneck
problem that has more recently made itself more prominent in
the binge-era of streaming media. It's an easy concept that
many people can understand without having an extensive
technical or musical background. The simplicity of the
concept also makes it dangerous.
</p>
<p>The Magic Music Box is a flawed notion because it itself is
an unbounded problem incognito. What seems like a
low-hanging-fruit idea can quickly turn into a black hole of
a project, filled with nothing but bland music that nobody
really asked for.
</p>
<p>Later, I will expand upon some of the reasons why Magic
Music Boxes are doomed to fail.</p>
