<h1>Kuf</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><code>Kuf</code> is a small program for generating patterns that
conform to the rules of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kufic#Square_Kufic">square kufic calligraphy</a>,
written in ANSI C.
</p>
<p>It's probably going to integrate with <a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>,
and may be used with the <a href="/wiki/codex">Candy Crystal Rainbow Codex</a>.
</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>Kuf is written as a <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate program</a> via <a href="/wiki/worgle">worgle</a>. The woven
HTML output can be <a href="/loom/kuf">read online</a> using
the <a href="/wiki/loom">loom</a>.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>TBD.
</p>

<h2>Logs</h2>

<p>Below are logs about the progress of Kuf, extracted from
the <a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a> of <a href="/wiki/">this wiki</a>.
</p>
<p><blockquote>
<b>2021-01-07 17:44:49</b>: (<a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a>) is now at the (<a href="/wiki/loom">loom</a>): the TOC page can be found <a href="/loom/kuf">here</a>.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-07 17:39:12</b>: thinking I may add (<a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a>) to the loom early, before I upload the code itself. Right now, it is complete enough for display.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-07 17:23:52</b>: then some square primitives, defined as macros? these could be used to make initial drawings, which could then be processed by the block filter to make tesselations "technically correct".
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-07 17:22:50</b>: A block can now be written to a PBM file. What should happen now is a more generic PBM file that can write an arbitrary NxM array of squares (not blocks) to a PBM file.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-07 15:39:00</b>: the block generator seems to work now. gonna make a PBM exporter next and turn that into the example file.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-07 11:13:33</b>: almost done being able to generate a block with (<a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a>). I must say, it's very promising that I'm able to jump right back into this project after a 5 month hiatus. I think that's one point for (<a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate_programming</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 18:04:42</b>: initial eastwall solver implemented, but untested.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 17:44:42</b>: I'm using cardinal directions to represent sides, and it's really exposing how directionally challenged I am.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 17:24:25</b>: really anything that ends up being a song or picture in the end usually ends up being a satisfying investment of time.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 17:18:13</b>: this (<a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a>) project is very satisfying to code up. it's got a very nice bottoms-up structure to it that feels very clean. I love systems composed using only a handful of simple operations.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 11:52:07</b>: once I build blocks, hoping to create some integrations with (<a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>) inside of (<a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>). Then, get it used in the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 11:45:37</b>: an initial implementation was made yesterday. it can now generate squares (4x4) tilesets. now extending things to make blocks (8x8 tilesets).
