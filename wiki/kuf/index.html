<title>Kuf</title>
<h1>Kuf</h1>
<p><code>Kuf</code> will be a small program for generating patterns that
conform to the rules of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kufic#Square_Kufic">square kufic calligraphy</a>.
It's probably going to integrate with <a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>,
and may be used with the <a href="/wiki/codex">Candy Crystal Rainbow Codex</a>.

<p><blockquote>
<b>2021-01-07 11:13:33</b>: almost done being able to generate a block with (<a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a>). I must say, it's very promising that I'm able to jump right back into this project after a 5 month hiatus. I think that's one point for (<a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate_programming</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 18:04:42</b>: initial eastwall solver implemented, but untested.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 17:44:42</b>: I'm using cardinal directions to represent sides, and it's really exposing how directionally challenged I am.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 17:24:25</b>: really anything that ends up being a song or picture in the end usually ends up being a satisfying investment of time.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 17:18:13</b>: this (<a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a>) project is very satisfying to code up. it's got a very nice bottoms-up structure to it that feels very clean. I love systems composed using only a handful of simple operations.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 11:52:07</b>: once I build blocks, hoping to create some integrations with (<a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>) inside of (<a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>). Then, get it used in the (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-06 11:45:37</b>: an initial implementation was made yesterday. it can now generate squares (4x4) tilesets. now extending things to make blocks (8x8 tilesets).
