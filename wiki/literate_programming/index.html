<title>Literate Programming</title>
<h1>Literate Programming</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate programming</a> is a programming paradigm invented by
Donald Knuth.
</p>
<p>The core concept in literate programming is to better
leverage natural language to better increase the readability
of a program.
</p>

<h3>Example Literate Programs</h3>

<p>The following are works of the author that explore literate
programming
</p>

<h4>Worgle</h4>

<p><a href="/wiki/worgle">Worgle</a> is tangler for literate programs
written in org markdown. Worgle is written in a literate
style using Org, and is tangled in code using itself.
</p>

<h4>Patchwerk</h4>

<p><a href="/proj/patchwerk">Patchwerk</a> is a C library for creating
reasonably efficient audio graphs. It is written in CWEB.
</p>

<h4>Monolith</h4>

<p><a href="/wiki/monolith">Monolith</a> is a compositional
environment with an emphasis on realtime audio and live
coding. The core program is written in a literate style
using Org markdown and <a href="/proj/worgle">Worgle</a>. It is
perhaps the single largest example of a program
written in Org Markdown.
</p>

<h4>Libline</h4>

<p><a href="/proj/libline">libline</a> is a library for creating
audio-rate line segements, written as a literate
program in CWEB.
</p>

<h4>Voc</h4>

<p><a href="/proj/voc">Voc</a> is a C port of
<a href="https://dood.al/pinktrombone/">pink trombone</a>. It is a
physical model of the vocal tract. Voc is written
using CWEB.
</p>

<h3>Notable Literate Programs</h3>

<p>Good literate programs that you should know about,
if you don't know them already.
</p>

<h4>TeX</h4>

<p>The original TeX typesetting system was written by Donald
Knuth using WEB, his literate programming tool.
</p>

<h4>PBRT</h4>

<p>The textbook
<a href="https://pbrt.org">Physically Based Rendering Techniques</a>,
or PBRT for short, is both a textbook on physically modelled
raytracing techniques, and a program which compiles to a
very capable raytracer. It is written using a homegrown
version of noweb.
</p>

<h3>Tools for Literate Programming</h3>


<h4>WEB/CWEB</h4>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEB">WEB</a> was the original
literate programming system developed by Donald Knuth. It
was most famously used to develop the TeX typesetting
system. The original WEB was built to tangle PASCAL code.
A version for the C programming language was developed
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWEB">CWEB</a>.
</p>

<h4>Noweb</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/">noweb</a> is a literate
programming system that aims to be simpler and more flexible
than the WEB system. Noweb has the ability to target HTML
and TeX system, and can work with any language.
</p>

<h4>OrgMode</h4>

<p><a href="https://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> is a highly configurable
outlining system commonly used for note taking and
task management. Org mode is capable of noweb style
literate programming via
<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming">Babel</a>.
</p>

<h4>Leo</h4>

<p><a href="http://leoeditor.com/">Leo</a> is an outline-based 
IDE that provides a very powerful environment for literate
programming. It is highly suggested to read
<a href="http://leoeditor.com/preface.html">A brief summary of leo</a>.
</p>

<h4>Eve</h4>

<p>Eve was an experimental IDE heavily
<a href="http://witheve.com/deepdives/literate.html">inspired by literate programming</a>.
