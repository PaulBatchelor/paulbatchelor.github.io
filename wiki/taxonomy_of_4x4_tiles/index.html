<title>Taxonomy of 1-bit 4x4 Tiles</title>
<h1>Taxonomy of 1-bit 4x4 Tiles</h1>
<p>A taxonomy of <code>1-bit</code> 4x4 tiles, as decreed by Zens
on Merveilles, adapted to WeeWiki format.
</p>
<p>A work in progress. It needs pictures.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This taxonomy groups 4x4 1-bit tiles into categories based
on symmetries:
</p>
<p>Inverse of colors.
</p>
<p>Horizontal flip.
</p>
<p>Vertical flip.
</p>
<p>90 degree rotations.
</p>
<p>wrap-around offsets of the pixesl (2 and 1 pixels, up and
down making this 4 total mutations)
</p>
<p>the above in every possible combintation
</p>
<p>sorted by the unique results.
</p>

<h2>Pure Colors and Checkerboard</h2>

<p>There's two patterns that yield only two unique results
after undergoing all the permutations described above:
<code>checkerboard</code> and pure <code>colors</code> black/white.
</p>

<h2>Stripes</h2>

<p>The <code>stripes</code> set is the only set that has 4 unique
symmetries.
</p>
<p>Zens: I like stripes. It's not number one, but he's a little
trooper. The rebel. The loner. No one like her. Always
changing their mind.
</p>

<h2>Halfchar and hatch</h2>

<p>The <code>halfchar</code> and <code>hatch</code> sets yield 8 patterns.
</p>
<p>Zens: these are the workhorses. You could draw whole words
with just these.
</p>

<h2>Big Blocks</h2>

<p>The <code>big blocks</code> pattern has 8 variations.
</p>
<p>Zens: This one is amazing. It's got 4 identities. It can be a not
<b>and</b> a cross. Shift it a bit, and you've got a double-sized
check. And third, you've got 4 directions of space ship.
What an amazingly versatile pattern. Imagine how much
space you could save on your atari cart.
</p>

<h2>Jaunty Angle</h2>

<p>The <code>jaunty angle</code> has a total of 8 combinations.
</p>
<p>Zens: as much as I love mx stripey, I love a jaunty angle,
and here's two. In some configurations we even get
a space alien. Or a chyron? Could be lots of things.
IMAGINATION.
</p>

<h2>Mx. Stripy</h2>

<p>16 combinations.
</p>
<p>Zens: Mx. Stripy! oh my! looks live you've had a stripe
removed, and you're doing a little dance.
</p>

<h2>Dots</h2>

<p>16 combos.
</p>
<p>Zens: Some strategically placed dots can be very handy for
some dither patterns.
</p>

<h2>Crenelations</h2>

<p>Zens: what do I call these? I think <code>crenelations</code> is an
appropriate. Two groups of 16. You like zigs? You like zags?
We've got both bases covered.
</p>

<h2>Diagonal Line</h2>

<p>Zens: amazing what you can do with just a single diagonal
line, drawn from corner to corner. or two. who's counting?
oh that's right. I am.
</p>

<h2>Squarish Zig Zags</h2>

<p>Zens: look at these wide bois. they're like
delicious candy wrappers. Open up!
Just be careful how you arrange those
squarish zig zags.
</p>

<h2>32 groups</h2>

<p>zens: there are many many more 32 groups. 34 of them to be
exact. It's a little unsatisfying really, that it isn't 32.
