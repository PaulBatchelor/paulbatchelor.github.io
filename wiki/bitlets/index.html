<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a id="overview"></a><code>bitlets</code> is an etude series that develops a symbolic
language designed to be programmed on the monome grid.
</p>
<p>The underlying system is a system called <code>bitrune</code>, which
implements a parser capable of reading bitmap "glyphs"
3 bits tall, written on the grid. Each symbol when called,
can evaluated a small string of lua code (usually just
a single function). These lua functions can then work
together to build up sound structures.
</p>
<p>To begin, there are no symbols. The process here will
involve creating a local set up symbols that can be used
together to create etudes. The process will be documented
here.
</p>
<p>An etude is represented as a set of tiles configured to
represent rows of bitglyphs. A graphic representation
comes with every etude.
</p>
<p>There is also asemic
<b>poetry</b> which is procedurally generated (as seen in
the <a href="/wiki/bitlets#TOC">table of contents</a>. Some
explanation is warranted here.
</p>
<p>The poetry is a procedurally generated text-based
representation of the bitglyphs on the grid. Each stanza
corresponds with a row, and each word corresponds with a
glyph. A word is composed of syllables, which outlines the
pattern of the glyph itself. Each syllable represents a
vertical slice in the glyph. Thus, a bitglyph 4-bits wide
will have 4 syllables.
</p>
<p>There are a total of 7 syllables: pa, fa, thu, de, yu, go,
ha. These syllables are arranged <code>physiologically</code>: the
sounds in the front of the mouth, and work backwards.
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p><a id="setup"></a>For my live coding setup (when this file is an org document).
</p>
<pre><code>(chdir "/home/paul/p/tudes/bitlets")
(lil "lua_new lua")
(lil "lua_dofile [grab lua] run.lua")

(define (mac3)
  (display "reloading play.lua")
  (newline)
  (lil "lua_dofile [grab lua] play.lua"))

(define (playtog)
    (lil "hstog [grab hs]"))</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>I program bitlets primitives from emacs in a pretty silly
way.
</p>
<p>I leverage org-babel's ability to send things to scheme
REPLs. But, I'm mostly programming Lua, because this scheme
implementation can't internally evaluate itself too easily.
But, I use scheme as a macro language. Core components are
wrapped in a small TCL-like called lua.
</p>
<p>So, for those keeping score: Scheme evals LIL code,
which loads an instance of Lua, and then calls "dofile" to
re-evaluate a playground file called "play.lua". This then
gets brought back into the core bitlets file.

<h2>Part 0: numbers, clock, envelope, oscillator, reverb, mul, add</h2>

<p><a id="part0"></a><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/etudes/et_0.png">
</p>
<p>To begin: numbers.
</p>
<p>Numbers will allow some sense of parametric control. At this
abstraction layer, supporting any number takes up too much
space on the grid.
</p>
<p>Instead, a few glyphs will be used to represent some small
integer values. These will act less as numbers, and more
as switches.
</p>
<p>Numbers 1-9 will be implemented. If more are needed, then so
be it.
</p>
<p>One:

<p>Nine:

<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/nine.png">
</p>
<p>Clocks. Clocks are the timing control signal primitive.
These can get fed into sequencers and envelope generators.
This will take in an integer parameter that will set up what
kind of clock there will be.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/clock.png">
</p>
<p>Envelope. An envelope generator. To be triggered by a clock
signal.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/env.png">
</p>
<p>Oscillator. This will probably utilize a lot of modes in
the future. For now, it is only a steady pitched subtractive
sawtooth.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/osc.png">
</p>
<p>Reverb. Always a good thing to have. Configured to be
mono in/out. The default setting will be the big verb
I like.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/reverb.png">
</p>
<p>Multiply will be used with the envelope and the oscillator.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/mul.png">
</p>
<p>Add will be used with the reverb and dry signal.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/add.png">
</p>
<p>And finally, an output.

<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/out.png">
</p>

<h2>Part 1: variation</h2>

<p><a id="part1"></a><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/etudes/et_1.png">
</p>
<p>Adding some variation to the core nodes.
</p>
<p>Clock: make the clock irregular.
</p>
<p>Envelope: smaller, more transient.
</p>
<p>Oscillator: random frequency.
</p>
<p>Reverb: smaller.
</p>

<h2>Part 2: initial gesture</h2>

<p><a id="part2"></a><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/etudes/et_2.png">
</p>
<p>With some initial test sounds out of the way, my focus
now shifts to my previous explorations in Gesture.
</p>
<p>I have created a gesture sequencer, which conceptually
lies in between a breakpoint line generator, a
classic step sequencer and an automation curve editor.
</p>
<p>The gesture sequencer works by reading in an external
timing signal (known as the conductor), reading a score,
and then using the two to synthesize an audio-rate line
segment suitable for modulating parameters of other nodes.
</p>
<p>Some new mechanisms will be added to our existing library:
</p>
<p>A conductor will need to be set up and instantiated. To save
space, this will be read by those that need it.
</p>
<p>A gesture will be formed in bitrune by declaring a new
gesture, creating the score, and then synthesizing the
gesture.
</p>
<p>The challenge for gesture sequencing is to keep the notation
terse yet expressive. Difficult, considering the overall
throughput of the Grid.
</p>
<p>A decent starting point would be to consider the "page"
in bitrune as a unit for containing a single gesture.
One can evenly divide up the two tri-strand rows using
two 2-width glyphs as bookends (start/end of gesture),
and 4 groups of 2 glyph combos, consiting of a 2-width
and 3-width glyph.
</p>
<p>Another helpful hint would be to consider the notation
as not notes, but as "words" or phrases.
</p>
<p>So, this is my approach.
</p>
<p>Before a gesture can begin, the global conductor must be
configured.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/conductor.png">
</p>
<p>Gestures start and end with the following glyphs:
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/gest_start.png">
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/gest_end.png">
</p>
<p>Inside these, gestures can be created. In this case,
a test melody.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/melody.png">
</p>
<p>I've also added some variations to out that
mute and quiet.
</p>
<p>Mute takes an incoming signal and multiplies it by
zero.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/mute.png">
</p>
<p>Quiet creates a zero signal.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/quiet.png">
</p>

<h2>Part 3: gesture continued</h2>

<p><a id="part3"></a><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/etudes/et_3.png">
</p>
<p>The previous etude illustrated a gesture with a
completely pre-composed sequence. This will attempt
to introduce mechanics with a bit more expressivity,
with a sensitivity for brevity.
</p>
<p>The approach here will be to construct gesture sequences
from smaller pre-composed chunks, whose timing is scaled.
</p>
<p>Like before, the conductor is set up (mode 1).
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/one.png">
<img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/conductor.png">
.
</p>
<p>Like before, a gesture for pitch is started,
with these as bookends:
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/gest_start.png">
<img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/gest_end.png">
</p>
<p>A new symbol is added, which tells the gesture
to create a new phrase 4 beats long.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/phrase4.png">
</p>
<p>A pre-defined melodic is placed inside this phrase
(melody 2). It fills up the whole phrase:
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/two.png">
<img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/melody.png">
</p>
<p>The phrase is formally closed. This is a new symbol:
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/endphrase.png">
</p>
<p>Another phrase is created, this time 3 beats long:
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/phrase3.png">
</p>
<p>The melodic phrase (melody 2) is repeated, and placed inside
of this phrase. It has now been compressed to 3 beats
instead of 4:
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/two.png">
<img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/melody.png">
</p>
<p>And then the phrase is ended.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/endphrase.png">
</p>
<p>One final phrase of is appended to this gesture: melody 3.
It is 4 beats long.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/phrase4.png">
<img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/three.png">
<img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/melody.png">
<img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/endphrase.png">
</p>
<p>This pitch gesture now will feed the oscillator, set to be
mode 3. Mode 3 is configured to read the pitch gesture:
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/three.png">
<img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/osc.png">
</p>
<p>The output of the oscillator is fed into a reverb in mode 3.
This mode will take in a signal and add the dry and the wet
signal together. This saves up valuable screen space:
</p>
<p><img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/three.png">
<img src="/res/wiki/bitlets/glyphs/reverb.png">
</p>
<p>Finally, the reverberated signal is sent to the speaker:
