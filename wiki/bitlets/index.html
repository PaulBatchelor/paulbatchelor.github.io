<title>Bitlets (Work in progress)</title>
<h1>Bitlets (Work in progress)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>An etude series that develops a symbolic language
designed to be programmed on the monome grid.
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>For my live coding setup (when this file is an org document)h.
</p>
<pre><code>(chdir "/home/paul/p/tudes/bitlets")
(lil "lua_new lua")
(lil "lua_dofile [grab lua] run.lua")

(define (mac3)
  (display "reloading play.lua")
  (newline)
  (lil "lua_dofile [grab lua] play.lua"))

(define (playtog)
    (lil "hstog [grab hs]"))</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>I program bitlets primitives from emacs in a pretty silly
way.
</p>
<p>I leverage org-babel's ability to send things to scheme
REPLs. But, I'm mostly programming Lua, because this scheme
implementation can't internally evaluate itself too easily.
But, I use scheme as a macro language. Core components are
wrapped in a small TCL-like called lua.
</p>
<p>So, for those keeping score: Scheme evals LIL code,
which loads an instance of Lua, and then calls "dofile" to
re-evaluate a playground file called "play.lua". This then
gets brought back into the core bitlets file.
</p>

<h2>Part 1: numbers, clock, envelope, oscillator, reverb, mul, add</h2>

<p>To begin: numbers.
</p>
<p>Numbers will allow some sense of parametric control. At this
abstraction layer, supporting any number takes up too much
space on the grid.
</p>
<p>Instead, a few glyphs will be used to represent some small
integer values. These will act less as numbers, and more
as switches.
</p>
<p>Numbers 1-9 will be implemented. If more are needed, then so
be it.
</p>
<p>Clocks. Clocks are the timing control signal primitive.
These can get fed into sequencers and envelope generators.
This will take in an integer parameter that will set up what
kind of clock there will be.
</p>
<p>Envelope. An envelope generator. To be triggered by a clock
signal.
</p>
<p>Oscillator. This will probably utilize a lot of modes in
the future. For now, it is only a steady pitched subtractive
sawtooth.
</p>
<p>Reverb. Always a good thing to have. Configured to be
mono in/out. The default setting will be the big verb
I like.
</p>
<p>Multiply will be used with the envelope and the oscillator.
</p>
<p>Add will be used with the reverb and dry signal.
</p>

<h2>Part 2: variation</h2>

<p>Adding some variation to the core nodes.
</p>
<p>Clock: make the clock irregular.
</p>
<p>Envelope: smaller, more transient.
</p>
<p>Oscillator: random frequency.
</p>
<p>Reverb: smaller.
</p>

<h2>Part 3: gesture</h2>

<p>With some initial test sounds out of the way, my focus
now shifts to my previous explorations in Gesture.
</p>
<p>I have created a gesture sequencer, which conceptually
lies in between a breakpoint line generator, a
classic step sequencer and an automation curve editor.
</p>
<p>The gesture sequencer works by reading in an external
timing signal (known as the conductor), reading a score,
and then using the two to synthesize an audio-rate line
segment suitable for modulating parameters of other nodes.
</p>
<p>Some new mechanisms will be added to our existing library:
</p>
<p>A conductor will need to be set up and instantiated. To save
space, this will be read by those that need it.
</p>
<p>A gesture will be formed in bitrune by declaring a new
gesture, creating the score, and then synthesizing the
gesture.
</p>
<p>The challenge for gesture sequencing is to keep the notation
terse yet expressive. Difficult, considering the overall
throughput of the Grid.
</p>
<p>A decent starting point would be to consider the "page"
in bitrune as a unit for containing a single gesture.
One can evenly divide up the two tri-strand rows using
two 2-width glyphs as bookends (start/end of gesture),
and 4 groups of 2 glyph combos, consiting of a 2-width
and 3-width glyph.
</p>
<p>Another helpful hint would be to consider the notation
as not notes, but as "words" or phrases.
