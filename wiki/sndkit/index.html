<h1>sndkit</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><code>sndkit</code> (or SNDKIT), self-described as a "sonic toolkit for
everyone", is a project started in 2020 that aims to be
a loose collection of <code>audio</code> <code>DSP</code> implementations written
in a <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate style</a>.
</p>
<p>The main landing page can be found <a href="/sndkit/">here</a>.

<h3>Twtxt updates</h3>

<p>Here are some relevant <a href="/wiki/twtxt">twtxt</a> tweets from my

<b>2020-11-17 16:11:05:</b> phsclk is an algorithm that divides an incoming phasor signal into an arbitrary number of ticks that are equally spaced. <a href="/sndkit/phsclk">phsclk</a> #sndkit #updates
<hr>
<b>2020-11-13 09:38:00:</b> new sndkit algorithm: <a href="/sndkit/expmap">expmap</a> creates an exponential curve from a linear ramp. #sndkit #updates
<hr>
<b>2020-10-09 13:24:21:</b> added <a href="/sndkit/bezier">bezier</a> to (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>) today. coupled with <a href="/sndkit/oscf">oscf</a>, it is capable of making some really weird wet FM-y sounds. Me like! #updates #sndkit
<hr>
<b>2020-10-07 09:17:55:</b> a new addition to (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>): <a href="/sndkit/oscf">oscf</a> is an arbitrary size table-lookup oscillator with floating point precision. #updates #sndkit
<hr>
<b>2020-10-06 21:20:03:</b> some initial words + code for a table-lookup oscillator with floating point precision to be included in (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>). testing and monolith come tomorrow. #updates #sndkit #monolith
<hr>
<b>2020-09-23 11:06:03:</b> also hoping to bring bits of #sndkit into #9front and #neindaw. maybe build a whole professional-quality music production platform around plan9 concepts instead of the tired cliche of emulating analog workflows? #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-23 11:02:22:</b> this morning I planned lots of #halfbakedideas for #sndkit in the near-distant future: a ROMpler with crossfading capabilities and optional input, and vowel formant filter, paired with a physical model of the glottis.
<hr>
<b>2020-09-09 13:36:36:</b> automatically generated #TeX equations implemented in (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>)
<hr>
<b>2020-09-08 20:22:45:</b> the <a href="/sndkit/chaosnoise">chaosnoise</a> algo is now in (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>) and (<a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>) #DSP #chaos #noise #patchwerk #monolith #crackle
<hr>
<b>2020-09-04 08:40:04:</b> implemented Zavalashin's 1-pole VA lowpass filter <a href="/sndkit/valp1">valp1</a> #sndkit #dsp

<h3>Zet Updates</h3>

<p>Page Updates from this wiki's <a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>.
</p>
<p><blockquote>
<b>2021-01-20 12:46:56</b>: one of the nice things about LIL is that it's very editor agnostic, unlike LISPy languages like janet or scheme or fe. It's also smaller than Lua too.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-20 12:45:47</b>: today someone mentioned the idea of providing some test executables in (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>). This got me thinking about this idea I've had for a while of using the LIL scripting language in a project. That + patchwerk + glue could be interesting, and very flexible moving forward.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-19 12:01:05</b>: I held off from doing this move for a while because I didn't want this project to grow too quickly. Popular projects are a double-edged sword...
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-19 12:00:10</b>: In other words, it makes it almost as easy to jump in and use as (<a href="/wiki/soundpipe">soundpipe</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-19 11:59:02</b>: a local copy of worgle has been imported into sndkit, which is a big step, as it reduces friction for those wishing to use the code.
</p>
<p><b>2021-01-15 09:06:45</b>: decided to publish some the initial words and ideas for my granular delay line I came up with a few months ago. No code yet, but I think it's a solid start. <a href="/loom/bugz">bugz</a>. My hope is to make it a part of (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>) as well.
