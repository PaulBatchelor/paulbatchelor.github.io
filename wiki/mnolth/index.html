<title>MNOLTH</title>
<h1>MNOLTH</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>MNOLTH is the successor to <a href="/wiki/monolith">monolith</a>.
</p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<p>A read-only <a href="/wiki/fossil">fossil</a> export to git can
be found
on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pbatch/mnolth">sourcehut</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/mnolth">github</a>.
</p>

<h2>Differences from Monolith</h2>

<p>(Other than having less letters in the name), mnolth
differs slightly from monolith when it comes to design
and scope. Generally, mnolth attempts to be a bit more
portable and smaller.
</p>
<p>Monolith comes included with realtime support (via JACK)
and first-class support for monome devices such as
<a href="/wiki/arc">arc</a> or <a href="/wiki/grid">grid</a>. Mnolth does not have
built-in realtime support. It is mainly used for generating
offline audio and video files. There's also no built-in
monome support either.
</p>
<p>mnolth is built on top of <a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>, and
uses <a href="/wiki/LIL">LIL</a> as a DSL for making audio patches.
Monolith uses <a href="/wiki/runt">runt</a> as the intermediate
language.
</p>
<p>Monolith uses a fork of s9 scheme and Janet as
frontend languages, with several language specific
bindings. Mnolth uses tinyscheme, and also recently
introduced lua. Overall, there are less C primitives
defined compared to Monolith.
</p>
<p>Mnolth can build and run on Termux on Android. Monolith
will not.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Mnolth can be best thought of as <a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>,
supercharged with goodies from other projects that aren't
included in the sndkit distro.
</p>
<p>The simplest mnolth patches are written in
<a href="/wiki/LIL">LIL</a>, a tiny TCL-like scripting language. These
have the lil extension, and are run via the <code>mnolth</code>program. Any sndkit patch written in LIL should be able
to run with mnolth.
</p>
<p>For more complex programs, one uses a sripting language
on top of LIL. The most supported one currently is scheme
via tinyscheme, but a lua frontend is being developed, and
will probably end up being the preferred choice. The
scheme interpreter is run via <code>mnoscm</code>, and the lua
interpreter is run via <code>mnolua</code>. Both of these programs
have ways of evaluating in-line chunks of LIL code, which
abstractions can be built around.
</p>
<p>LIL is not a fast or sophisicated language. But that's sort
of the point. The main point of LIL is to be just usable
enough to outline sndkit sound patches. Hence, the languages
on top. Why do it this way? This design keeps the C
abstraction from getting too tangled up with the more
complex APIs like Lua.
</p>
<p>Usually, LIL
is only used to build up an audio graph at runtime, so
performance is a non-issue. However, mnolth does have a
number of simple drawing primitives exposed as LIL
commands that must be called every frame. Graphics needs
and scope are modest: tiny and non-realtime. At the moment,
it's tolerable. More interactive and complex things may
be beyond the scope of mnolth.
