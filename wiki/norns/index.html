<title>Norns</title>
<h1>Norns</h1>
<p>The norns is a portable linux-based sound computer.
</p>
<p>More to add later.
</p>

<h3>How to connect via serial</h3>

<pre><code>minicom -D /dev/ttyUSBN</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Usually, it is <code>/dev/ttyUSB2</code> for me, because the
grid + arc are already plugged in.
</p>
<p>When in there, Ctrl-a o to get to hardware options, then
serial port setup.
</p>
<p>Hit 'f' to disable hardware control flow. I think I had
to do this to make it possible to type?
</p>
<p>Exit out of the menu with escape.
</p>

<h3>WIP Compiling Monolith for norns</h3>

<p>A bit of an ordeal at the moment. Sorry about that.
Will be less bumpy in the future. Still trying figure
things all out.
</p>

<h4>TODO Making the "norns" folder inside monolith</h4>

<p>And what should be inside
</p>

<h4>TODO config file for norns</h4>


<h4>TODO Compiling Runt</h4>

<p>Make sure config.mk has the following compilers set.
<pre><code>CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
AR=arm-linux-gnueabihf-ar</pre></code>
<p>Run <code>make</code>, then copy
</p>
<p><code>runt.h</code>  to NORNS/include
</p>
<p><code>librunt.a</code> to NORNS/lib
</p>

<h4>Compiling Patchwerk</h4>

<p>The gist of this.
</p>
<p>Make sure you have ctangle installed.
</p>
<p>Tangle patchwerk.c with "make patchwerk.c".
</p>
<p>go into the runt folder.
</p>
<p>Make sure you have a config file that looks like this:
<pre><code>CC = arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
AR = arm-linux-gnueabihf-ar

CFLAGS += -I$(HOME)/proj/monolith/norns/include
CFLAGS += -DNO_LIBSNDFILE

# override default LIBS
LIBS = -L$(HOME)/proj/monolith/norns/lib
LIBS += -lsoundpipe -lm -lrunt -lpthread</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Should be called <code>config.mk</code>, if called something else, like
<code>config-norns.mk</code>, make sure <code>CONFIG</code> environment variable
is properly set.
</p>
<p><code>~/proj/monolith/norns/include</code> should be the folder where
you are putting files (runt is needed to be compiled first
to work).
</p>
<p>Run <code>make</code>.
</p>
<p>Copy the following files to your norns folder:
</p>
<p>libruntpatchwerk.h to NORNS/include
runtpatchwerk.a
</p>

<h4>TODO Compiling Soundpipe</h4>


<h4>TODO Compliling Monolith</h4>


<h3>TODO Setting Up Buildroot + Image</h3>

<p>More or less was a pretty standard buildroot, with the
norns buildroot configs.
</p>

<h3>TODO Setting up SSH + SCP</h3>

<p>At the time of writing, these weren't included with
the buildroot image, so I had to compile manually. I used
dropbear, which also had an scp implementation included.
</p>

<h3>TODO Startup Files</h3>

<p>Systemd stuff, and some shell scripts I use.
