<title>Programming the "Right Way"</title>
<h1>Programming the "Right Way"</h1>
<p>Every time this concept of doing things the "right way" come
up in programming, I am reminded of this quote from John Carmack.
</p>
<pre><code>Now, a great deal of stuff that goes on in the aerospace
industry should not be emulated by anyone, and is often
self destructive. Most of you have probably read various
popular articles about the development process that
produces the space shuttle software, and while some people
might think that the world would be better if all software
developers were that careful, the truth is that we would
be decades behind where we are now, with no PC s and no
public internet if everything was developed at that snail's
pace.</pre></code>
