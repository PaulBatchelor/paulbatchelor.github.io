<title>Reasons to get a Pocket Watch</title>
<h1>Reasons to get a Pocket Watch</h1>
<p>Go get yourself a Pocket Watch. Not a bad investment.
</p>
<p>The most important thing a pocket watch can do is get you
off your phone a little bit. If you need to check the time,
use the pocket watch instead of the phone. If you are going
somewhere and all you need is to know the time, take the
pocket watch, and leave the phone at home. The issue is that
phones do more than tell the time. Those other things
can be stressful anxiety-inducing things that can pop up
every time you just want to check the time.
</p>
<p>A mechanical wind-up pocket watch does not require a battery
or electricity. All it needs is is a human being with
intent. Just wind, set the current time, and off ya go. The
watch I got for myself, a Gotham Railway Classic, needs to
be wound up about once a day. It's a fun little daily ritual
to have.
</p>
<p>Pocket watch displays do not turn off. They are always on,
ready to tell you the time. The exception to this is when
you don't have any light. So, you might want to get yourself
a flashlight while you're at it.
</p>
<p>The analogue watchface is a great mental model for
grokking time. Colloqial phrases like "quarter 'til noon"
and "half past 8" only make sense on an analogue watch face.
</p>
<p>They are great fidget toy. Smooth, round.. a mechanical
marvel to watch and put up to your ear.
</p>
<p>If you put a pocket watch on a cell phone stand, it becomes
a desk clock!
</p>
<p>Ditch the chains though.
