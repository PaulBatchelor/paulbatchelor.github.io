<h1>Ergo ID</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The <code>Ergo</code> ID system is a ergonomically efficient way
to type out UUIDs on a QWERTY keyboard layout. It was
specifically written for <a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>, specifically
<a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a>, as a faster, more comfortable means
for managing tasks.
</p>
<p>As an example, this UUID4 value:
</p>
<p>6b73c608-f0cd-4f4b-97f7-11756e04f195
</p>
<p>Would translate to the following ergo-id:
</p>
<p>krlfukaq-paui-hphr-wlpl-ssljkoahpswj
</p>
<p>It's honestly a pretty bonkers system. I came up with this
idea while dogfooding <a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a>. I particularly
found typing UUIDs, even partially, to be a laborious
operation, in particular when typing numbers on my
<a href="/wiki/planck">planck keyboard</a>.
</p>
<p>I figured that while hexadecimal notation makes
a lot of sense from a symbolic point of view, it's
not great if you are tasked with actually typing
them out. With my fingers resting on the home row,
I thought about the issue. Next thing you know... Ergo ID!
</p>

<h3>Derivation</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID</a> is
a 128-bit number, usually represented as 32 hexadecimal
characters with 4 dashes. It is the convention to represent
those 16 hexadecimal characters 0-9 and a-f. In the Ergo ID
system, these characters are replaced with easy-to-reach
ones found on the home and top rows of the keyboard.
</p>
<p>For a touch typist, the easiest characters to reach are
on the home row without extending. On a QWERTY keyboard,
these are:
</p>
<p>asdfjkl;
</p>
<p>These are all letters except for the ';'. That's a bit
of an odd duck. ';' will be replaced with 'h'. it requires
an extension, but it's not so bad. also, vi users will
appreciate the hjkl pattern:
</p>
<p>asdfhjkl
</p>
<p>The next easiest keys are found on the top row without
extension. 'p' has a bit of an extension, but it's not too
bad (and it also feels slightly more comfortable than 'y'):
</p>
<p>qweruiop
</p>
<p>Together, these form 16 characters, which is how many
we need to represent the hexadecimal characters:
</p>
<p>asdfhjklqweruiop
</p>
<p>0123456789abcdef
</p>

<h3>Sample C Implementation</h3>

<p>Here's some starter C code, adapted from the <a href="/loom/weewiki">weewiki</a> source code. Each function takes in an input
string, the input string size, and a pre-allocated buffer
for the output string. The output string is assumed to be
at least the same size as the input string (plus an extra
byte for the null terminator), but does
not do any checking so be careful!
