<title>A Recipe For Learning Audio Programming</title>
<h1>A Recipe For Learning Audio Programming</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This document aims to provide a loose guide for
those interested in learning about audio programming,
specificially low-level audio DSP development.
It is particular geared for musically inclined
individuals. At one point, I was a kid in music
school trying to figure this stuff out for myself.
This is the guide I wish I had starting out.
</p>

<h2>Code is a terrible way to learn DSP</h2>

<p>Looking at code is a terrible way to learn about DSP.
Trust me, I tried it with <a href="/wiki/soundpipe">soundpipe</a>.
Didn't work.
</p>
<p>By the time an algorithm finds its way into a C/C++
implementation, most of the bits that would have helped
you learn about it have stripped away. Many components are
usually pre-derived or optimized away. Programming syntaxes
like C/C++ also notate DSP in a very obfuscated way. Even
audio DSLs like FAUST or SOUL are like this to an extent.
</p>
<p>This isn't to say avoid looking at code. In fact, quite the
opposite. Find as much existing code as possible, use it to
explore and interact. But don't expect things to suddenly
make sense with just code alone.
</p>
<p>The best way to learn this kind of stuff is to learn the
theory, and how to study the mathematical notation behind
it. I hate to say it because I'm terrible at math, but
I've found this to the true. Concepts didn't start making
sense until I was enrolled in a DSP class during my masters
program, surrounded by engineers instead of musicians.
</p>
<p>Learning theory is beyond the scope of this document,
and I'm not comfortable giving advice about that.
All I'll say is find a good mentor, and DO THE PROBLEM SETS.
Also, a little goes a very long way. If you're anything like
me, you're interested in musical applications, and not
theory for the sake of theory. Make sure your mentor
understands this.
</p>

<h2>Audio programming is mostly math</h2>

<p>There's very little programming in an audio program. It
mostly comes down to a glob of arithmetic operations in a
loop. "It's all just multiplies and adds", as a friend of
mine says. There's very little for newbies to grab on to.
If you have a background in CS or software engineering,
it can be challenging because there's structures or
algorithms to cling on to.
</p>
<p>Most of the audio programming skill comes from taking
mathematical models and representations of algorithms, and
carefully implementing them to efficiently work in code.
You'll want to be mindful of the constraints involved with
developing software in realtime.
</p>

<h2>Most programming languages aren't suitable for audio DSP</h2>

<p>Most programming languages are
<a href="http://www.rossbencina.com/code/real-time-audio-programming-101-time-waits-for-nothing">not suitable for realtime audio</a>.
Usually this comes down to how memory is managed, but other
things can come into play too.
</p>
<p>So, if you're gonna seriously commit to learning this stuff,
you might commit to something that won't burn you in the
end.
</p>
<p>Here are some highly opinionated choices that are all
suitable for realtime audio:
</p>
<p><code>C</code> is a classic. I <a href="/wiki/whyc">personally use C</a>.
I know, it's a
footgun. But it's also extremly portable,
and there's a lot of existing code and tooling available.
</p>
<p><code>Rust</code> is also a suitable choice, and it seems to be gaining
momentum. I can't say much more on that, as I don't use it.
But I'll probably be paid to write Rust code someday.
</p>
<p><code>Zig</code> could also be a good choice for audio programming, too.
I am interested in project, and may even try to learn it
some day for free someday.
</p>
<p>Lots of people in the "audio programming community" will
tell you that you need to learn <code>C++</code>. You don't <b>need</b>to learn C++, but learning it will help you land
employment in the industry, if you're into that
sort of stuff.
Personally, I don't know or use much C++ in my work, and
this me cut off from the audio programming community at
large. I consider this a feature, not a bug.
</p>

<h2>Offline First, then Realtime</h2>

<p>One of the (few) things I did right was to avoid trying to
make realtime audio apps, and instead
focus on writing offline programs
that generate audio files. You get started so much faster,
it's less boilerplate, easier to configure, easier to debug,
etc. Stick to command line apps, no GUI stuff.
</p>
<p>libsndfile is a great starting point. The first program
I studied was
<a href="https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/blob/master/examples/make_sine.c">this sine wave</a>.
The real game changer though was
<a href="https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/blob/master/examples/sfprocess.c">sfprocess.c</a>.
Learning how this example worked was the catalyst that
would eventually bring <a href="/wiki/soundpipe">soundpipe</a> into
existence.
</p>
<p>Write stupid programs that generate audio files, then
bring those audio files into your existing workflow
samplers and DAWs! Always do things in the direction of
music. Always.
</p>
<p>I should also mention that going from offline to realtime
is much easier than going from realtime to offline. Both
my Soundpipe and <a href="/wiki/sporth">sporth</a> projects were originally
offline only and I wasn't even interested in making either
work in realtime. But, the transition to realtime was mostly
a smooth one, mostly because I wasn't doing anything fancy.
Meanwhile, LMMS, a DAW built with realtime at it's
inception, and over a decade later, there are still issues
related to offline rendering. Mark my words, it's because
they tried to do fancy things like use a multi-threaded
engine (yikes) and utilize oversampling.
</p>

<h2>Avoid Plugins for a while</h2>

<p>This is pretty much the same point as above. Plugins
are massive balls of complexity, and they just add weight
to the learning process. It makes most things harder than
they should be.
</p>
<p>The only thing that newbies should be thinking about is
that core inner DSP loop. Sliders, knobs, GUIS, live input,
etc can wait.
</p>
<p>I should mention: while it makes plugin development
exceptionally easier, JUCE is not for newbies. It's built
for experienced C++ developers who write audio plugins
professionally. It's also a ball of complexity masking
many other balls of complexity.
</p>
<p>Seriously, just stick
to writing tiny command line programs that make WAV files
for a bit. It's a lot of fun!
</p>

<h2>Avoid FAUST for a while</h2>

<p>Learn FAUST at some point. It's great. But it can be learned
later. To me, FAUST is best appreciated after you've done
some work in a lower level language like C/C++. Usually
you'll need to be using glue C++ code with FAUST anyways.
For the simpler DSP algorithms, sometimes FAUST can be
overkill.
