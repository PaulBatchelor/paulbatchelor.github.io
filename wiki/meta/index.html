<h1>Meta</h1>
<p>This is an experimental meta page that will query
the <code>meta</code> group in the internal <a href="/wiki/zettelkasten">zettelkasten</a> of this wiki.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-20 11:11:31</b>: it looks like I whacked out all the literate programs that were clogging up the (<a href="/wiki/keywords">keywords</a>) page. much more helpful now. now I just need to better utilize this feature.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-20 10:54:06</b>: I have quite a few literate programs here, and they are gumming up the (<a href="/wiki/keywords">keywords</a>) page. now that I have the (<a href="/wiki/loom">loom</a>), it doesn't make sense to keep them here.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 21:02:22</b>: created a page for the Candy Crystal Rainbow Codex (<a href="/wiki/codex">codex</a>). it's a stub for now"
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 20:56:50</b>: that's how fast computers are. you can just go back and forth between whole formats and a years worth of logs in a blink of an eye. astounding.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 20:54:09</b>: I really am tempted now to import my entire (<a href="/wiki/twtxt">twtxt</a>) feed into my (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>), then add them to their own twtxt group. From there I can export it back to twtxt format, and life would go on as usual.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 20:46:49</b>: added initial (<a href="/wiki/cdb">cdb</a>) page.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 11:21:01</b>: just connected the (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) and (<a href="/wiki/crate">crate</a>) pages to (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>). That's a neat zet trick.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 11:06:37</b>: more words to the (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) page, including a quickstart
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-19 10:23:04</b>: some good stuff is happening with the weewiki zet page wrt sample curation. will have to update the (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>) page soon.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 11:11:31</b>: added (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) page
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 11:08:18</b>: added a page for meta-pages: (<a href="/wiki/metapages">metapages</a>)
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 10:54:44</b>: Thinking I should try to get (<a href="/wiki/feed">feed</a>) like formatting here. Testing: (<a href="/wiki/meta">meta</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-18 10:49:10</b>: Created a new group today called @create. Anything to do with creation or creating goes here. Software development is excluded here. #hello
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-17 21:29:00</b>: some fumbles, by I think this meta page is working. good proof of concept.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-17 18:02:04</b>: the scale of this should be quite manageable compared to my sample curation project where auto-imports were generating 60k+ entries.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-17 18:00:50</b>: I'm not quite sure what I'll be using the zet for <b>here</b>. but it sure is fun and easy adding stuff to it.
</p>
<p><b>2020-12-17 17:59:49</b>: a lot of interesting new features exploded today working on my (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>) project.
