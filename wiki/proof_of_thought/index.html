<title>Proof of Thought</title>
<h1>Proof of Thought</h1>

<h2>Concept</h2>

<p>"Proof of Thought" is a concept in <code>programming</code> loosely
based on the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work">proof of work</a>.
When examining code of a program, it can be difficult to
gauge exactly how much thought went into writing each line.
A proof of thought is something that the programmer can do
to show how much (or how little) human thought went into the
lines of code.
</p>

<h2>Literate Programming as Proof of Thought</h2>

<p>The prose found in a <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate program</a> can be used as proof of thought.
Reading the words in a literate program, one can roughly
gauge the amount of effort the programmer put into the
program. More thoughtful parts will have a cohesive
narrative with good flow. Bits with lots of words describing
only a few lines of code are typically a indicator of
particularly complex, confusing, or counter-intuitive code.
Less thoughtful parts will be riddled with typos and in dire
need of an editor.

<p>The author admits his programs own programs are more often
than not in dire need of an editor.
