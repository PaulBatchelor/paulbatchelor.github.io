<title>Thoughtful Programming</title>
<h1>Thoughtful Programming</h1>
<p></p>
<p>This is a work in progress concept.
</p>
<p>Thoughtful Programming is a loose term that applys to any
paradigm or technique that encourages deep thought about a
problem before writing any code.
</p>
<p>Any half-decent programmer understands that actual coding is
the easy and fast part. It is the thought process that goes
into the lines that is the time consuming and difficult
part. This distinction separates programming from coding.
</p>
<p>In my experience, I've found that once code has been
written, it is very hard to unwrite it. More often, code
is a ball of clay. Once it exists, the best you can do is
mold it to fit the demands of the day. If you are building
anything remotely worthwhile, it is helpful to stop and
think about things.
</p>
<p>Modern-day compilers do not help with thoughtful
programming. They are insanely fast and deliver results
faster than we can think. Because of this, it is easy to
adopt a meandering "guess and check" approach to developing
a program. We all do this. I still do this. It's convenient
and fast. But it is still sloppy. When you find yourself
throwing code at a compiler and seeing what sticks, you are
in a bad spot. Thoughtful programming breaks the
compile-and-check loop, and gets people to actually <b>think</b>
about what they are doing.
</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/literate_programming">literate programming</a> paradigm is a good example of 
a tool for thoughtful programming. It allows a
programmer to think about and structure the problem using
natural language structure. A programmer could, for instance
write out the entire program in plain English before writing
a single line of code. Said programmer in this instance
would be a thoughtful one.
</p>
<p>Literate programming can also provide a subjective metric
for thoughtfulness. It can difficult to determine
how much thought has been put into a given line of code.
Maybe that line was put in place after days of debugging.
Maybe it was a quick hack for an intense deadline. Sometimes
they can look the same. Prose in a literate program can be
a barometer for code quality. If it looks like well written
couple of paragraphs accompanying a couple lines of code,
it's probably an important part of the program that the
author put a lot of time into. If you see typos and things
that don't make a lot of sense, it's probably not the
greatest quality code either. I call this *proof of
thought*.
