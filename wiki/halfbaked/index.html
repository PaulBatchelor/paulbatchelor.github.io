<h1>halfbaked</h1>
<p>An automatically curated collection of half-baked ideas from
my <a href="/wiki/twtxt">twtxt</a> <a href="/wiki/feed">feed</a>. Anything with the
tag <code>#halfbakedideas</code> should show up here.

<b>2020-10-21 19:12:44:</b> the fe language by rxi would make for a great frontend for generating txtvm code maybe #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-13 17:51:02:</b> I need a loom for all my random woven literate programs. #halfbakedideas #literateprogramming
<hr>
<b>2020-10-09 17:27:55:</b> a 1-bit delay line? basically could be used to store audio-rate impulses, clocks, and triggers. the buffer would be a bitbuffer, so it would be a very memory-efficient. the notion of feedback some kind of feedback could be compelling too... #halfbakedideas #1bit
<hr>
<b>2020-10-09 14:20:57:</b> saw this great writeup once on how somebody visualized data by drawing faces with them, and letting our brain's natural face feature-extraction algorithms interpret the data. Kinda want to try to do that with some of these samples and waveforms I'm curating. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-09 13:30:32:</b> This morning I had this really weird notion of building a generative podcast complete with musical interludes and asemic speech using a speech synthesizer. It'd be interesting to have "interviews" with two distinct vocal characters. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-07 10:05:51:</b> a 1bit version of this iconset would be pretty neat <a href="https://icons.mono.company/">https://icons.mono.company/</a> #links #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-01 14:47:07:</b> suddenly I have an urge to build a concatenative macro language to go along with this (<a href="/wiki/txtvm">txtvm</a>) project of mine. Together, they maybe could build a more <a href="/wiki/thoughtful_programming">thoughtful</a> (<a href="/wiki/runt">runt</a>)? #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-28 16:05:57:</b> so, having the etudes be ~20mb/minute for sound AND video ain't too bad, and that's before doing any sort of compression. My etudes are almost always 80-120 seconds long, so the total size of a lossless uncompressed etude would be ~40mb, consistently. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-28 16:03:05:</b> sound for #breathingcard etudes in 44.1 kHz mono 32-bit floating point sound. that's about ~10mb a minute raw uncompressed audio. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-28 16:01:03:</b> my #breathingcard etudes are 128x64 resolution videos with 4x zoom, that normally use no more than 4 colors (2-bits) using a 2-bit color storage format, that's ~7mb a minute for raw uncompressed 60 fps video. not bad. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-28 15:45:01:</b> I've been thinking about storing the output of some of my audio-visual etudes in a more portable lossless 4-bit indexed color format, rather than rely on x264 directly. #halfbakedideas #etudes #breathingcards #longterm
<hr>
<b>2020-09-23 11:06:03:</b> also hoping to bring bits of #sndkit into #9front and #neindaw. maybe build a whole professional-quality music production platform around plan9 concepts instead of the tired cliche of emulating analog workflows? #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-23 11:02:22:</b> this morning I planned lots of #halfbakedideas for #sndkit in the near-distant future: a ROMpler with crossfading capabilities and optional input, and vowel formant filter, paired with a physical model of the glottis.
<hr>
<b>2020-09-12 18:43:02:</b> a western music theory textbook, but reimagined to actually make sense for computers instead of humans. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-10 11:16:05:</b> support for homemade :emojis: in my HTML feed parser? perhaps. perhaps not. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-04 15:54:35:</b> listening to some of Tim Follin's 1-bit work on the ZX Spectrum makes we want to try do make 1-bit music on the (<a href="/wiki/arduboy">arduboy</a>) #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-31 09:32:28:</b> thinking about implementing some noise generators for (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>). A chaos noise generator that leverages numerical instabilities in IEEE floating point, and a 1-bit linear feedback shift register noise generator based on NES audio. #sndkit #halfbakedideas #dsp
<hr>
<b>2020-08-12 09:23:17:</b> A AM radio modulator filter. Put one or more signals into it, and virtually tune between them like you would on a radio. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-12 09:21:48:</b> An NES-inspired noise source. Basically, 1-bit noise using a linear-feedback shift register algorithm, as defined in the NES specs. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-04 12:33:52:</b> an extendable text editor inside of a Blit that tries really hard not to edit text. #halfbakedideas
