<p>An automatically curated collection of half-baked ideas from
my <a href="/wiki/twtxt">twtxt</a> <a href="/wiki/feed">feed</a>. Anything with the
tag <code>#halfbakedideas</code> should show up here.

<b>2020-08-03 20:21:50:</b> somehow get (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>) pages rendered in (<a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>). maybe build a btprnt backend for links browser? #halfbakedideas

<b>2020-07-31 08:58:43:</b> a microblogging creative coding platform like dwitter, but for sound. users would be encouraged to remix, the output of one persons code would become the input of the new code. only text would be stored on the server, with audio rendered client-side. to save on time, there could be caches of frozen audio for remixes. #halfbakedideas

<b>2020-07-29 17:19:40:</b> a music sequencer, but for producing continuous gestures instead of discrete steps. have it be clocked with an external source so it can play well with others. perhaps build a notation system around it. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-29 11:04:47:</b> (<a href="/wiki/txtvm">txtvm</a>), a text-based toy VM, used to run tiny domain-specific bytecode programs using only printable ascii characters. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-29 06:39:06:</b> a 1-bit synthesizer and sequencer for the (<a href="/wiki/arduboy">arduboy</a>) #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-28 16:12:43:</b> I really want (<a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>) to be integrated into (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>) somehow. Both can speak (<a href="/wiki/janet">janet</a>), and I already figured how to embed PNG images inside of an HTML document. In small doses, it could be fun. #halfbakedideas

<b>2020-07-28 12:24:00:</b> the idea would be to build and share tiny 6.5 bit programs encoded as printable ascii characters. this could then in turn be read by a virtual computer to do things like paint a picture or compose a piece of music. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-28 12:19:44:</b> a 6.5 bit fantasy computer, whose bytecode representation can be represented entirely as printable ascii characters. The first 6 contain standard data space, with the 7th bit used to represent one of 32 values. #halfbakedideas
