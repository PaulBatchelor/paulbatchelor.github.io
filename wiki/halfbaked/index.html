<p>An automatically curated collection of half-baked ideas from
my <a href="/wiki/twtxt">twtxt</a> <a href="/wiki/feed">feed</a>. Anything with the
tag <code>#halfbakedideas</code> should show up here.

<b>2020-10-07 10:05:51:</b> a 1bit version of this iconset would be pretty neat <a href="https://icons.mono.company/">https://icons.mono.company/</a> #links #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-01 14:47:07:</b> suddenly I have an urge to build a concatenative macro language to go along with this (<a href="/wiki/txtvm">txtvm</a>) project of mine. Together, they maybe could build a more <a href="/wiki/thoughtful_programming">thoughtful</a> (<a href="/wiki/runt">runt</a>)? #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-28 16:05:57:</b> so, having the etudes be ~20mb/minute for sound AND video ain't too bad, and that's before doing any sort of compression. My etudes are almost always 80-120 seconds long, so the total size of a lossless uncompressed etude would be ~40mb, consistently. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-28 16:03:05:</b> sound for #breathingcard etudes in 44.1 kHz mono 32-bit floating point sound. that's about ~10mb a minute raw uncompressed audio. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-28 16:01:03:</b> my #breathingcard etudes are 128x64 resolution videos with 4x zoom, that normally use no more than 4 colors (2-bits) using a 2-bit color storage format, that's ~7mb a minute for raw uncompressed 60 fps video. not bad. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-28 15:45:01:</b> I've been thinking about storing the output of some of my audio-visual etudes in a more portable lossless 4-bit indexed color format, rather than rely on x264 directly. #halfbakedideas #etudes #breathingcards #longterm
<hr>
<b>2020-09-23 11:06:03:</b> also hoping to bring bits of #sndkit into #9front and #neindaw. maybe build a whole professional-quality music production platform around plan9 concepts instead of the tired cliche of emulating analog workflows? #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-23 11:02:22:</b> this morning I planned lots of #halfbakedideas for #sndkit in the near-distant future: a ROMpler with crossfading capabilities and optional input, and vowel formant filter, paired with a physical model of the glottis.
<hr>
<b>2020-09-12 18:43:02:</b> a western music theory textbook, but reimagined to actually make sense for computers instead of humans. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-10 11:16:05:</b> support for homemade :emojis: in my HTML feed parser? perhaps. perhaps not. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-04 15:54:35:</b> listening to some of Tim Follin's 1-bit work on the ZX Spectrum makes we want to try do make 1-bit music on the (<a href="/wiki/arduboy">arduboy</a>) #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-31 09:32:28:</b> thinking about implementing some noise generators for (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>). A chaos noise generator that leverages numerical instabilities in IEEE floating point, and a 1-bit linear feedback shift register noise generator based on NES audio. #sndkit #halfbakedideas #dsp
<hr>
<b>2020-08-12 09:23:17:</b> A AM radio modulator filter. Put one or more signals into it, and virtually tune between them like you would on a radio. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-12 09:21:48:</b> An NES-inspired noise source. Basically, 1-bit noise using a linear-feedback shift register algorithm, as defined in the NES specs. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-04 12:33:52:</b> an extendable text editor inside of a Blit that tries really hard not to edit text. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-03 20:21:50:</b> somehow get (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>) pages rendered in (<a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>). maybe build a btprnt backend for links browser? #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-02 09:19:54:</b> The Content Creator at Innsmouth Trail #lovecraftian #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-31 08:58:43:</b> a microblogging creative coding platform like dwitter, but for sound. users would be encouraged to remix, the output of one persons code would become the input of the new code. only text would be stored on the server, with audio rendered client-side. to save on time, there could be caches of frozen audio for remixes. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-29 17:19:40:</b> a music sequencer, but for producing continuous gestures instead of discrete steps. have it be clocked with an external source so it can play well with others. perhaps build a notation system around it. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-29 11:04:47:</b> (<a href="/wiki/txtvm">txtvm</a>), a text-based toy VM, used to run tiny domain-specific bytecode programs using only printable ascii characters. #halfbakedideas
