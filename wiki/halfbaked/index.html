<b>2021-07-19 10:49:51:</b> play/pause/stop is not a great interaction, but it does count. thinking of interactive music as a gradient rather than a dichotomy (interactive vs non-interactive) seems like a healthier way to think about things. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-07-17 17:34:38:</b> creating vocal tract shapes using the monome grid, and then morphing between them using something like (<a href="/wiki/gest">gest</a>). #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-07-17 17:33:27:</b> musical experience that involve harvesting, farming, growth, and caretaking of virtual musical creatures with personality. creatures would socialize with eachother and their interactions would change the overall musical sounds implicitely. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-07-17 17:31:39:</b> implicit music, or the idea that music naturally exudes from everything. composition is not the act of making music, but of starting with music and working backwards. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-07-09 20:57:57:</b> my little travel pillow arrived today for my feet while sitting in the meditation bench. paired with my foam pad for my knees, I think I can begin trying to test this out for my future portable kneeling workspace. #updates #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-07-05 15:03:58:</b> conceptualizing the monome grid as a highly accurate low-density monochrome display #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-06-26 11:03:04:</b> on a monome 16x8 grid, you can get 10 consecutive 3x3 blocks in a 2x5 configuration. what's left is a narrow 1x vertical strip, and a 2x horizontal strip. interesting divisions for a glyph based interface with controls. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-06-24 09:52:46:</b> low-res hard-edged SDFs in btprnt. mainly as a way to compose organic looking geometry. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-06-24 09:46:27:</b> I want to somehow use my monome grid to build out coarse vocal tract shapes for a physical model like (<a href="/wiki/voc">voc</a>) or <a href="/sndkit/tract">tract</a>. 16 diameters with 8 steps of resolution, or 32 diameters with 4 steps of resolution. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-03-09 16:15:43:</b> using a forked version of ed to do live coding #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-03-04 09:47:10:</b> my tiny screen can comfortably display a text block of 45 lines with a maximum length of 79 characters. wonder what kind of information is possible to convey with that kind of information density... #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-02-09 14:07:24:</b> a decentralized community (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>). individual zet feeds could be managed using something like git/git submodules, then built locally into self-contained SQLite files. zet items would be referenced by their zet nickname and UUID. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-02-01 17:07:53:</b> with (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) and (<a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a>), I find myself constantly needing to type out UUIDs. thing is, they aren't the easiest thing to type. might invent an intermediate typer-friendly intermediate UUID format that can then convert to the regular UUID format. #halfbaked
<hr>
<b>2021-01-28 18:01:19:</b> a supplementary component to (<a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a>) called something like "due", which schedules items in the TODO and dynamically creates schedules similar to org-agenda. #halfbaked
<hr>
<b>2021-01-27 19:47:19:</b> SQL(ite) and zettelkastens as a medium for non-linear story telling. #halfbaked
<hr>
<b>2020-12-02 10:47:46:</b> smoothstep is a stateless smoother function commonly used in computer graphics. could be interesting in the audio domain as well (parameter smoothing, phase warping/distortion synthesis, etc): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep</a> #links #halfbaked
<hr>
<b>2020-12-02 10:14:05:</b> I had this notion yesterday of ignoring whitespace completely in (<a href="/wiki/txtvm">txtvm</a>). this could allow for some ascii-art patterns in the output (similar to what some IOCC entries do). #halfbaked
<hr>
<b>2020-11-24 10:52:56:</b> thinking of computer interfaces as being hypertypewriters #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-20 10:26:02:</b> tool-mind vs toy-mind #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-17 15:33:22:</b> tools encourage creation. toys encourage discovery. sometimes these overlap. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-16 19:41:25:</b> plans for weewiki: a zettelkasten-like interface, a microblogging platform inspired by (<a href="/wiki/twtxt">twtxt</a>), and some utilities for managing collections of SQLar archives. #updates #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-04 15:07:42:</b> I <b>gotta</b> put hatching patterns in (<a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>). I just gotta. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-04 11:05:47:</b> the concept of literally typed languages. as in, languages designed to be satisfying to type. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-03 17:23:30:</b> a crossfade loop delay line. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-02 10:15:51:</b> I've recently been reading up on zettelkastens again, since it is very closely related to the ethos of a personal wiki system like (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>). The thing that interests me is the emergent patterns that come from linking things to things. Which is <b>exactly</b> the sort of solution I'm looking for (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>). #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-02 10:09:43:</b> not to mention there's lots of interesting transformations one can apply to the linear ramp of a phasor signal. movable midpoint as seen in phase distortion synthesis and (<a href="/wiki/phasewarp">phasewarp</a>). exponential and <a href="/sndkit/bezier">bezier</a> mappings. Not to mention all the trig functions and waveshaping synthesis techniques. All these things would warp tempo in interesting periodic ways. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-02 10:04:37:</b> it's also easy to use scaling and wrap operations to transform a phasor signal into smaller/larger phasor signals, allowing for interesting rhythmic microcosms that stay in sync #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-02 10:02:05:</b> I'm hoping to build a phasor-to-clock signal generator, which divides up a phasor into an arbitrary number of ticks. Using a global phasor as a global clock would allow for interesting polyrhythms, as well more flexible precision in sequencers. It's also closer to how human-based conducting works. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-21 19:12:44:</b> the fe language by rxi would make for a great frontend for generating txtvm code maybe #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-09 14:20:57:</b> saw this great writeup once on how somebody visualized data by drawing faces with them, and letting our brain's natural face feature-extraction algorithms interpret the data. Kinda want to try to do that with some of these samples and waveforms I'm curating. #halfbakedideas
