<b>2021-03-09 16:15:43:</b> using a forked version of ed to do live coding #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-03-04 09:47:10:</b> my tiny screen can comfortably display a text block of 45 lines with a maximum length of 79 characters. wonder what kind of information is possible to convey with that kind of information density... #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2021-02-09 14:07:24:</b> a decentralized community (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>). individual zet feeds could be managed using something like git/git submodules, then built locally into self-contained SQLite files. zet items would be referenced by their zet nickname and UUID. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-24 10:52:56:</b> thinking of computer interfaces as being hypertypewriters #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-20 10:26:02:</b> tool-mind vs toy-mind #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-17 15:33:22:</b> tools encourage creation. toys encourage discovery. sometimes these overlap. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-16 19:41:25:</b> plans for weewiki: a zettelkasten-like interface, a microblogging platform inspired by (<a href="/wiki/twtxt">twtxt</a>), and some utilities for managing collections of SQLar archives. #updates #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-04 15:07:42:</b> I <b>gotta</b> put hatching patterns in (<a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>). I just gotta. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-04 11:05:47:</b> the concept of literally typed languages. as in, languages designed to be satisfying to type. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-03 17:23:30:</b> a crossfade loop delay line. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-02 10:15:51:</b> I've recently been reading up on zettelkastens again, since it is very closely related to the ethos of a personal wiki system like (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>). The thing that interests me is the emergent patterns that come from linking things to things. Which is <b>exactly</b> the sort of solution I'm looking for (<a href="/wiki/sample_curation">sample_curation</a>). #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-02 10:09:43:</b> not to mention there's lots of interesting transformations one can apply to the linear ramp of a phasor signal. movable midpoint as seen in phase distortion synthesis and (<a href="/wiki/phasewarp">phasewarp</a>). exponential and <a href="/sndkit/bezier">bezier</a> mappings. Not to mention all the trig functions and waveshaping synthesis techniques. All these things would warp tempo in interesting periodic ways. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-02 10:04:37:</b> it's also easy to use scaling and wrap operations to transform a phasor signal into smaller/larger phasor signals, allowing for interesting rhythmic microcosms that stay in sync #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-11-02 10:02:05:</b> I'm hoping to build a phasor-to-clock signal generator, which divides up a phasor into an arbitrary number of ticks. Using a global phasor as a global clock would allow for interesting polyrhythms, as well more flexible precision in sequencers. It's also closer to how human-based conducting works. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-21 19:12:44:</b> the fe language by rxi would make for a great frontend for generating txtvm code maybe #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-13 17:51:02:</b> I need a loom for all my random woven literate programs. #halfbakedideas #literateprogramming
<hr>
<b>2020-10-09 17:27:55:</b> a 1-bit delay line? basically could be used to store audio-rate impulses, clocks, and triggers. the buffer would be a bitbuffer, so it would be a very memory-efficient. the notion of feedback some kind of feedback could be compelling too... #halfbakedideas #1bit
<hr>
<b>2020-10-09 14:20:57:</b> saw this great writeup once on how somebody visualized data by drawing faces with them, and letting our brain's natural face feature-extraction algorithms interpret the data. Kinda want to try to do that with some of these samples and waveforms I'm curating. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-09 13:30:32:</b> This morning I had this really weird notion of building a generative podcast complete with musical interludes and asemic speech using a speech synthesizer. It'd be interesting to have "interviews" with two distinct vocal characters. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-10-07 10:05:51:</b> a 1bit version of this iconset would be pretty neat <a href="https://icons.mono.company/">https://icons.mono.company/</a> #links #halfbakedideas
