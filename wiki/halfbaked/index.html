<h1>halfbaked</h1>
<p>An automatically curated collection of half-baked ideas from
my <a href="/wiki/twtxt">twtxt</a> <a href="/wiki/feed">feed</a>. Anything with the
tag <code>#halfbakedideas</code> should show up here.

<p><blockquote>
<b>2020-09-12 18:43:02:</b> a western music theory textbook, but reimagined to actually make sense for computers instead of humans. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-10 11:16:05:</b> support for homemade :emojis: in my HTML feed parser? perhaps. perhaps not. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-09-04 15:54:35:</b> listening to some of Tim Follin's 1-bit work on the ZX Spectrum makes we want to try do make 1-bit music on the (<a href="/wiki/arduboy">arduboy</a>) #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-31 09:32:28:</b> thinking about implementing some noise generators for (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>). A chaos noise generator that leverages numerical instabilities in IEEE floating point, and a 1-bit linear feedback shift register noise generator based on NES audio. #sndkit #halfbakedideas #dsp
<hr>
<b>2020-08-12 09:23:17:</b> A AM radio modulator filter. Put one or more signals into it, and virtually tune between them like you would on a radio. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-12 09:21:48:</b> An NES-inspired noise source. Basically, 1-bit noise using a linear-feedback shift register algorithm, as defined in the NES specs. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-04 12:33:52:</b> an extendable text editor inside of a Blit that tries really hard not to edit text. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-03 20:21:50:</b> somehow get (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>) pages rendered in (<a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>). maybe build a btprnt backend for links browser? #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-08-02 09:19:54:</b> The Content Creator at Innsmouth Trail #lovecraftian #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-31 08:58:43:</b> a microblogging creative coding platform like dwitter, but for sound. users would be encouraged to remix, the output of one persons code would become the input of the new code. only text would be stored on the server, with audio rendered client-side. to save on time, there could be caches of frozen audio for remixes. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-29 17:19:40:</b> a music sequencer, but for producing continuous gestures instead of discrete steps. have it be clocked with an external source so it can play well with others. perhaps build a notation system around it. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-29 11:04:47:</b> (<a href="/wiki/txtvm">txtvm</a>), a text-based toy VM, used to run tiny domain-specific bytecode programs using only printable ascii characters. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-29 06:39:06:</b> a 1-bit synthesizer and sequencer for the (<a href="/wiki/arduboy">arduboy</a>) #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-28 16:12:43:</b> I really want (<a href="/wiki/btprnt">btprnt</a>) to be integrated into (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>) somehow. Both can speak (<a href="/wiki/janet">janet</a>), and I already figured how to embed PNG images inside of an HTML document. In small doses, it could be fun. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-28 12:24:00:</b> the idea would be to build and share tiny 6.5 bit programs encoded as printable ascii characters. this could then in turn be read by a virtual computer to do things like paint a picture or compose a piece of music. #halfbakedideas
<hr>
<b>2020-07-28 12:19:44:</b> a 6.5 bit fantasy computer, whose bytecode representation can be represented entirely as printable ascii characters. The first 6 contain standard data space, with the 7th bit used to represent one of 32 values. #halfbakedideas
