<h1>Zetdo TODO</h1>
<p>A list of TODO items for <a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a>.
</p>

<h3>make it possible to set tasks to be highest/lowest priority</h3>

<p>moving stuff to the very top (and sometimes very bottom) is something I often find myself needing to do without calculating how many votes it would be.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-12 09:26:54</b>: the way this could work: get the max score, and then the ID score to be that plus 1.
</p>

<h3>figure out way to create tasks with subtasks</h3>

<p>document/create an approach making tasks with subtasks.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-12 09:32:12</b>: this will become more important as I start planning out larger projects, such as (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>) API and scripting capabilities in (<a href="/wiki/LIL">LIL</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-11 14:22:57</b>: zet links are too final. perhaps another variable? something like <code>belongs</code> in the subtask. this would make it so a task can only belong to one parent task at any given time.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>DONE items should not appear on agenda</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-09 09:45:33</b>: the quick fix for this is to add the lstdel command, which sets a task to be done and removes it from the list. this is good enough for me.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-08 19:50:15</b>: done items should be removed from the priority list. so some sort of cleanup command should be included with this. or maybe the cleanup command is how DONE tasks get removed?
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>print task title in hist command</h3>

<p>this gives more information about the task. makes it easier to know you selected the right one.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-09 10:37:00</b>: added (<a href="/wiki/boxit">boxit</a>) script, which is a good precursor to the task title printer I want.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>make a =tagged= command that lists all tasks with a given tag.</h3>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>make an option to order zetdo tasks by state timestamp.</h3>
