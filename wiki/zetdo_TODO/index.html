<h3>create more keyboard-friendly UUID format</h3>

<p>make it physically easier to type UUIDs by using keys that are easier to type on keyboards.
<blockquote>
<b>2021-02-01 19:53:05</b>: what to call this? lettercode? alphabetcode? alphabet? letters? alphaid? will need to think on this.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-01 19:52:16</b>: dashes will still be dashes
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-01 19:51:43</b>: most importantly, the (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) would be able to dynamically resolve UUIDs in this format if they are prefixed with a character 'A'. There would also need to be a text filter that could process tsv streams that would convert UUID fields (always second field) to be this format.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-01 19:50:25</b>: the initial brainstorm here is to use all lowercase alphabets. a would be 0, b would be 1, etc. weewiki would have ways to translate back and forth between UUIDs.

<h3>make a =tagged= command that lists all tasks with a given tag.</h3>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>a command called tags should list all available tags (aka zet groups belonging to zetdo group)</h3>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>make it possible to list all zetdo states</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-01-31 11:07:48</b>: the zetdo groups command probably should do this by default. at the moment, it lists <b>all</b> groups in the zet. in the zetdo scope, it should only print groups linked to the zetdo group.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>make an option to order zetdo tasks by state timestamp.</h3>
