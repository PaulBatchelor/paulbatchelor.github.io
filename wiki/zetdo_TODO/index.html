<h3>create more keyboard-friendly UUID format</h3>

<p>make it physically easier to type UUIDs by using keys that are easier to type on keyboards.
<blockquote>
<b>2021-02-01 21:19:29</b>: the problem is, all zetdo IDs will be in ergo, while zet operations will be UUIDs by default. I'll just have to remember to use the prefix when working with the zet directly (which should hopefully be less and less often).
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-01 21:16:59</b>: some initial words made in (<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>). After that work is completed, I should be able to build it into zetdo with minimal modification.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-01 21:02:23</b>: after writing some blurbs in weewiki, I've begun calling it an "ergo-id" because it's an ergonomically efficient way to input a UUID.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-01 19:53:05</b>: what to call this? lettercode? alphabetcode? alphabet? letters? alphaid? will need to think on this.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-01 19:52:16</b>: dashes will still be dashes
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-01 19:51:43</b>: most importantly, the (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) would be able to dynamically resolve UUIDs in this format if they are prefixed with a character 'A'. There would also need to be a text filter that could process tsv streams that would convert UUID fields (always second field) to be this format.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-01 19:50:25</b>: the initial brainstorm here is to use all lowercase alphabets. a would be 0, b would be 1, etc. weewiki would have ways to translate back and forth between UUIDs.

<h3>make a =tagged= command that lists all tasks with a given tag.</h3>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>a command called tags should list all available tags (aka zet groups belonging to zetdo group)</h3>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>make it possible to list all zetdo states</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-01-31 11:07:48</b>: the zetdo groups command probably should do this by default. at the moment, it lists <b>all</b> groups in the zet. in the zetdo scope, it should only print groups linked to the zetdo group.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>make an option to order zetdo tasks by state timestamp.</h3>
