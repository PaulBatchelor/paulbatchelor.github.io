<h2>add UUID abbreviations for comments with hist command</h2>

<a id="321f5365"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#321f5365">#321f5365</a>.

<h2>add timestamp field to zetdo info</h2>

<a id="a7e5e963"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#a7e5e963">#a7e5e963</a>.

<h2>hist function should display short UUIDs of comments</h2>

<a id="7ea272b7"></a><p>UUID: <a href="#7ea272b7">#7ea272b7</a>.
</p>
<p>that way, it can be easier to link to comments directly if desired.

<h2>it should be easier to trace what task a comment belongs to</h2>

<p><b>2022-03-13 10:50:28</b>: I'm starting to think that this might need to be a web thing, and that it's part of a larger issue of navigation. It would be nice to think about a smaller-scale solution and work up to that.
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-13 10:49:24</b>: I'm a little bit conflicted here about what results to display. Just UUIDs? or everything? Do you ignore links? include them?
</p>
<p><b>2022-03-10 13:29:19</b>: it should be easier to trace links in general. like, I should be able to click on a link and it should take me to that reference, or at least change the reference to something more human readable.
</p>
<p><b>2022-02-26 20:16:53</b>: every comment is a message that ties to another message that is linked to the zetdo group. A solution would involving looking a comment's links, and checking to see if any of those links are zetdo tasks.
</p>
<p><b>2022-02-26 20:13:18</b>: still thinking, though I forget what caused the need for this solution in the first place. Maybe search?
</p>
<p><b>2022-02-05 10:53:06</b>: will need to think on how to do this.

<h2>make an option to order zetdo tasks by state timestamp.</h2>
