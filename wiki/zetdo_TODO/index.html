<h1>Zetdo TODO</h1>
<p>A list of TODO items for <a href="/wiki/zetdo">zetdo</a>.
</p>
<p></p>

<h3>make a =tagged= command that lists all tasks with a given tag.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-12 10:22:21</b>: I've never formally spelled it out like that. But I could live with that general definition. it leaves flexibility for new things.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-12 10:21:44</b>: it gets harder to distinguish comments from tasks. at the moment, tasks do have a state variable. so maybe tasks are UUIDs whose values are messages that also have a state variable, that also belong to zetdo group.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-12 10:20:05</b>: we can make it so tagged only prints messages also in the zetdo group
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-12 10:19:07</b>: an initial placeholder command created.
</p>

<h3>figure out way to create tasks with subtasks</h3>

<p>document/create an approach making tasks with subtasks.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-12 10:14:28</b>: this is so silly. (<a href="/wiki/zet">zet</a>) links are perfect for this. I just need to code in a way to unlink things.
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-12 09:32:12</b>: this will become more important as I start planning out larger projects, such as (<a href="/wiki/sndkit">sndkit</a>) API and scripting capabilities in (<a href="/wiki/LIL">LIL</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2021-02-11 14:22:57</b>: zet links are too final. perhaps another variable? something like <code>belongs</code> in the subtask. this would make it so a task can only belong to one parent task at any given time.
</p>

<h3>print task title in hist command</h3>

<p>this gives more information about the task. makes it easier to know you selected the right one.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>2021-02-09 10:37:00</b>: added (<a href="/wiki/boxit">boxit</a>) script, which is a good precursor to the task title printer I want.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>make an option to order zetdo tasks by state timestamp.</h3>
