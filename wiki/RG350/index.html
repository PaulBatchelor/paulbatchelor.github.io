<h1>RG350</h1>
<p>The RG-350 is a portable gaming device running OpenDingux
Linux.
</p>
<p>These are my notes.
</p>
<p>You can SSH into the thing as root using
</p>
<pre><code>ssh root@10.1.1.2</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>On my computer, the subnets were already in place for
whatever reason and I could get in just fine.
</p>
<p>Be sure to use the right USB port to plug in.
</p>
<p>Using a USB C adapter, things like keyboard and mice
work with generic HID drivers.
</p>
<p>Other devices (monome grid, USB MIDI, etc) don't seem
to work.
</p>
<p>More to come!</p>
