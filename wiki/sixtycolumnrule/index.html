<title>Sixty Column Rule</title>
<h1>Sixty Column Rule</h1>
<p>A take on the classic 80 column rule, the 60 column rule
is a coding guidline which states that a line of code should
not exceed more than 60 characters. It is an experimental
rule that I am currently enforcing with all my more recent
programming project.
</p>

<h3>Motivations</h3>

<p>My initial motivation for trying out such a crazy idea came
after acquiring a <a href="/wiki/gpd_pocket_2">GPD Pocket 2</a>,
which only has a 7 inch screen. While using the device, I
found myself wanting to use larger beefier fonts for easier
readability. When dialing in comfortable settings, the total
line width of the screen ended up being around 70
characters, less than the desirable 80 characters. So, I
decided to see what it would be like to code with 60 column
rule. 60 is large enough to be functional, but small enough
to force noticeable changes in workflow.
</p>
<p>My interest is in seeing how using the 60 column rule
changes my coding style and programming behavior.
</p>

<h3>Thoughts so far</h3>

<p>Here is a list of some self-observations. In no particular
order.
</p>

<h4>Mono-Window setup</h4>

<p>I almost always have only one window at a time, and at
most 2. When I do split, it always has to be a horizontal
split, but the vertical split is too skinny. As a result,
less multi-tasking, less jumping between files.
</p>
<p>When split, each window only shows 16 lines at a time,
so the information conveyed is very limited.
</p>

<h4>Information Overload on larger screens</h4>

<p>I am genuinely used to the screen size now, to the point
where larger screens like my 15 inch MBP give me
information overload. Even my 10-inch chromebook feels roomy
now.
</p>

<h4>Outside projects are difficult</h4>

<p>Most code-bases are incompatible with a screen this size,
so it can be very tough navigating third-party code. This
set-up really only works with projects written in this
setup.
</p>
<p>The good news is that projects written in this setup can
be viewed in larger screens quite nicely.
</p>

<h4>Terser + skinnier coding style</h4>

<p>Programs now are visually terser and skinner. In C,
I am back to smaller functions with one-letter variable
names. This isn't too much of a cognitive load because the
functions are usually quite small in scope. Usually not
confusing. Usually.
</p>
<p>Function arguments are broken up into their own
lines. Emacs does an auto-align which I have grown to
appreciate. I hate being dependent on such things, but
sure does look great.
</p>

<h4>Org-mode header folding is mission critical</h4>

<p>Screen real-estate is precious, so I have come to be
dependent on the header folding/unfolding to show or
hide information. As a result, what I see on the screen
is exactly what I need to see.
</p>
<p>From a programming, this makes abstraction more important.
If I can't see the code, I can't expect to remember exactly
how it works. Breaking things up into components that fit
into a single screen becomes more important.
</p>
<p>Again, it makes me feel a bit uneasy knowing how dependent
I am on this feature that is <b>only</b> available through the
giant that is emacs, but things work fine for now.
