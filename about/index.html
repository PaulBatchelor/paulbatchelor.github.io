<!--I unknowingly began my music career at the impressionable age of 8 years old when I decided to pick up violin because I liked the way the instrument looked. At the age of 13, I discontinued my violin studies and picked up the upright bass. I mainly studied classical bass with Pascale Delache-Feldman, but also studied jazz bass with Jim Guttmann. I was principal bass for two years in the MMEA senior district orchestra, and principal bass for 3 years with the Longy Youth Chamber Orchestra. Other notable orchestras included the MMEA All-State orchestra and the Belmont Music Festival Orchestra. Armed with his upright and electric bass, I also played big-band and straight-ahead jazz, gospel, avant-garde jazz, rock, funk, and jazz fusion. When I graduated from Newton North High School in 2010, I received the prestigious Henry Lasker award.

Composition blossomed for me at around the same time my playing did. As early as elementary school, I began working with and creatively tweaking computers. This interest, combined with my musical experiences, developed into a passion for composition using computers.  At 16, I found The Csound Book, a guide for the Csound synthesis programming language, which would become a  principal tool in my computer music composition. At 18, I had written my first work using Csound for my senior year project. I was accepted into Berklee in the Fall of 2010, and was subsequently accepted into the Electronic Production and Design Program, where I studied Csound and Composition with Dr. Richard Boulanger, editor of The Csound Book, and composer of the first piece written in Csound. My compositional work has been featured in the 2013 International Csound Conference as well as at Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey in Mexico City. I have co-authored article on using Csound on the Raspberry Pi published by the Csound Journal which has been featured on hackaday.com and can be found online at www.csounds.com/journal/ in issue 18. -->

<p>Allow me to properly introduce myself:</p>

<p>My name is Paul Batchelor. I grew up in Newton Massachusetts, but home for me was wherever my bass went. Under the guidance of my teacher Pascale Delache-Feldman, my bass and I found home in countless concert halls, stages, clubs, and festivals. The nature of the bass (both upright and electric) allowed me to play many styles of music, and therefore allowed me to play for many styles of people. It was this kind of accessibility attached with the instrument that made playing very rewarding to me. </p>

<p>In 2014, I graduated from the Berklee College of Music with a degree in Electronic Production and Design. It was at Berklee that I learned about synthesis techniques, digital signal processing, and avant-garde computer music composition. While my weapon of choices has shifted from bass to computers, the excitement of accessibility remains the same in the kind of music I like to create.</p>
