<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi. My name is Paul Batchelor. That's my face up there.</p>
<p>I hold a masters degree from the Center for Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA), and a undergraduate degree from the Berklee College of Music,
where I majored in Electronic Production and Design.</p>
<p>I am a music technologist who enjoys exploring the various ways computation
and computational devices can be used to facillitate creative artistic 
expression. It is a adolescent medium, which I believe has deep potential for 
bringing positive social change at an enormous scale. As a musician, I try to 
focus on the ways computers can produce novel sounds as well as how they can 
assist in music composition process.</p>
<p>Here are some things that get me excited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generative Composition</li>
<li>Domain-specific languages and notation systems</li>
<li>Audio Signal Processing</li>
<li>Linux and FOSS</li>
<li>Embedded Systems</li>
<li>Computer Graphics</li>
<li>Demoscene </li>
</ul>
