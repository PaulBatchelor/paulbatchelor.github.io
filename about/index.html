<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Paul.</p>
<p>Most of my time is spent hunched over a computer
(usually my computer), occasionally muttering to myself
about this or that. On good days, I create music.
To distract myself from making music, I create music
software, in a process I often refer to as
"teaching computers how to sing".</p>
<p>Do you ever think about what it means to be a
computer? To compute? Or ever wonder what it means for
a computer to be an "artistic medium"? And while we're on
that subject, what is this "computer music" stuff, anyways?</p>
<p>Here are some things that get me excited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generative Composition</li>
<li>Modular Synthesis Environments</li>
<li>Domain-specific languages and notation systems</li>
<li>Audio DSP</li>
<li>Linux and FOSS</li>
<li>Embedded Systems</li>
<li>Computer Graphics</li>
</ul>
