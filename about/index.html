<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi. My name is Paul Batchelor. I sometimes resemble the
photograph above.</p>
<p>Most of my time is spent hunched over a computer
(usually my computer), occasionally muttering to myself
about this or that. On good days, I create music.
To distract myself from making music, I develop music
software, in a process I often refer to as
"teaching computers how to sing".</p>
<p>Do you ever think about what it means to be a
computer? To compute? Or ever wonder what it means for
computer to be an "artistic medium"? And while we're on
that subject, what is this "computer music" stuff, anyways?
These are just the sorts of questions that drive the kind of
work I do.</p>
<p>Here are some things that get me excited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generative Composition</li>
<li>Modular Synthesis Environments</li>
<li>Domain-specific languages and notation systems</li>
<li>Audio Signal Processing</li>
<li>Linux and FOSS</li>
<li>Embedded Systems</li>
<li>Computer Graphics</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about all I got for now. Thanks for visiting!</p>
