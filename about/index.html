<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Paul Batchelor. Allow me to talk about myself.</p>
<p>I would consider myself to be a sound designer, music technologist, and a half decent
programmer and composer.  In that order.</p>
<p>I was born in Boston, Massachusetts. In my youth, I studied classical and jazz bass.
I attended the Berklee College of Music, where I graduated out of their Electronic
Production and Design program. I am currently pursuing my Masters degree at CCRMA.</p>
<p>Some of my interests include Linux, Raspberry Pi computers, live coding, generative composition,
and the Unix philosophy.</p>
