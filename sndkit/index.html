<h1>sndkit</h1>
<p>sndkit is a sonic toolkit for everywhere.
</p>
<p>It is a collection of highly portable ANSI-C implementations
of audio DSP algorithms commonly used in computer music, all
wrapped up inside of a statically generated wiki.
</p>
<p>Each DSP algorithm is written in a literate programming
style, a technique pioneered by Donald Knuth. Surrounding
the implementation itself are words and equations used to
help explain and contextualize what every single line of
code is doing.
