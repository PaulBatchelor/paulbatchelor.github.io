<h1>sndkit</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>sndkit is a sonic toolkit for computer music composition.
</p>
<p>It aims to bring a collection of useful audio DSP algorithms
together in one ecosystem, and document how they work.
</p>
<p>Each algorithm in the <a href="/sndkit/algos">sndkit collection</a> is written using literate
programming, a paradigm that aims to present computer
structure using natural language. This means that each
algorithm has both an implementation (in ANSI C) as
well as a brief explanation for how the implementation
works.
</p>
<p>Sndkit provides a <a href="/sndkit/core">core C api</a> that allows
the algorithms to be connected together to created patches.
Patches can be conveniently built up using the
<a href="/sndkit/LIL_overview">LIL scripting language</a>, included
with the sndkit distribution.
</p>

<h2>Code and Installation</h2>

<p>The source code for this wiki can be found on
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pbatch/sndkit">SourceHut</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/sndkit">github</a>.
</p>
<p>A standard POSIX C compilation environment is required
(clang/gcc, Make, etc). There are no external third party
libraries. Everything required is included inside the
codebase, including a version of the tangler program
required to convert literate programs to C code.
</p>
<p>To compile, run:
</p>
<pre><code>make</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This will produce an executable called <code>sndkit</code>, which is
really a LIL interpreter fortified with sndkit functions.
</p>
<p>You can test it with:
</p>
<pre><code>./sndit examples/synthbass.lil</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Which should produce a WAV file in the current directory called
<code>synthbass.wav</code>.
</p>
<p>sndkit can be installed with:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo make install</pre></code>

<h2>Realtime Support?</h2>

<p>It is possible to run sndkit in realtime. However...
</p>
<p>To keep things reasonably portable and manageable,
realtime audio support is left as an exercise to the
reader ;)
</p>
<p>The only thing sndkit supports is offline rendering WAV
files.
</p>

<h2>Available DSP Algorithms</h2>

<p>The HTMLized version of the algorithms can be
browsed <a href="/sndkit/algos">here</a>.
