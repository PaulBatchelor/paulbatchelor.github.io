<title>Tables First</title>
<h1>Tables First</h1>
<p>There's a bit of a design quirk with sndkit nodes
that use tables (such as <a href="/sndkit/oscf">oscf</a> or
<a href="/sndkit/fmpair">fmpair</a>): tables go first. That is to say,
they are the first pushed onto the stack, and
the last to be popped.
</p>
<p>Why?
</p>
<p>Consider <code>fmpair</code>. In LIL, creating an fmpair node
could look like:
</p>
<pre><code>fmpair [gensine [tabnew 8192]] [mtof 60] 1 1 1 0</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This is annoying because any sophisticated patch requires
declaring the table before doing anything:
</p>
<pre><code># ugh, gotta push the table first onto the stack!
gensine [tabnew 8192]

# ... some complicated sequencing ..

mtof zz
fmpair zz zz 1 1 1 0</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>In other stack based systems previously built, it's always
been a convention to have the table argument be last,
as it make things quite convenient with postfix
notation:
</p>
<pre><code>60 mtof 1 1 1 0 8192 tabnew gensine fmpair</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Note how the last few words could just be abstracted away.
Very elegant.
</p>
<p>The problem is, sndkit uses LIL, which does not use postfix
notation.
</p>
<p>It would indeed be very nice to have LIL code looking like this
</p>
<pre><code># wouldn't this be nice?
fmpair [mtof 60] 1 1 1 0 [gensine [tabnew 8192]]</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>However, this doesn't work. Things evaluated in brackets
get pushed to the stack before constants like 1 and 0 do,
so it gets pushed out of order. 
</p>
<p>This line would work using the <code>param</code> function on
every variable:
</p>
<pre><code># it works now
fmpair [mtof 60] [param 1] [param 1] [param 1] [param 0] [gensine [tabnew 8192]]</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>That's a long line! And there's the rub. If the table were
the last argument, every parameter preceding it would need
to have <code>param</code>, which defeats any convenience of using LIL.
</p>
<p>So, the design choice was made to have tables go first. It's
the lesser of two inconveniences.
