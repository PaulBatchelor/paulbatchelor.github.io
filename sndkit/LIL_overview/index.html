<h1>LIL and sndkit: an overview</h1>

<h2>What is LIL?</h2>

<p><a href="http://runtimeterror.com/tech/lil/">LIL (Little Interpreted Language)</a> is a tiny scripting
language included with sndkit. Using LIL, one can connect
various sndkit algorithms together to build up sounds and
patches.
</p>
<p>Syntactically, LIL looks very similar to TCL:
</p>
<pre><code>print hello world</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Will print "hello world". The general format is to have
words separated by spaces. The first word is the command,
the following words are the arguments.
</p>

<h2>Sndkit functions</h2>

<p>sndkit adds several functions to LIL. Most of these are
sndkit algorithms wrapped into a unit generator that takes
in input signals and returns one or more output signals.
</p>
<p>The following code can be used to produce a sine wave at
440Hz with an amplitude of 0.5:
</p>
<pre><code>sine 440 0.5</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>If you were to run this program, you wouldn't hear any
sound. To get sound, the output of the sine wave would need
to be written to a WAV file. And then some audio would need
to be computed.
</p>
<p>The following code creates a 10 second WAV file of a sine:
</p>
<pre><code>wavout [sine 440 0.5] "sine.wav"
computes 10</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Using the brackets [], the sine wave signal is computed and
sent as input to the WAV file writer wavout, writing to a
file called "sine.wav". The computes command runs the patch
for 10 seconds.
</p>
<p>One could use nested brackets to build s-exprsdsion like
constructs. This creates a sine wave whose pitch is being
modulated by another sine wave to create vibrato:
</p>
<pre><code>sine [add [param 440] [sine 6 50]] 0.5</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Add adds two signals together, in this case a constant 440
and a sine wave at 6Hz with an amplitude of 50. This causes
the sounding sine wave oscillator to go up 50Hz and then
down 50hz.
</p>
<p>The param function starts needing to be used when arguments
mix and match constants and evalulated signals using
brackets. Any constants that appear before bracketted
arguments need to use param. This is why the 440 constant
needs a param, and the 0.5 does not require one (though it
doesn't hurt to add). It's a weird quirk that has to do
with evaluation order and how things work under the hood,
but one gets used to it.
</p>

<h2>The 'zz' operator</h2>

<p>Brackets and s-expressions can be fun, but they can get
very unwieldy very quickly in LIL, especially since
backslashes are required to break up commands across
different lines.
</p>
<p>The previous vibrato example can be rewritten without
brackets using a special function called 'zz':
</p>
<pre><code>sine 6 50
add zz 440
sine zz 0.5</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>zz itself doesn't do anything. It is a placeholder that
tells the function to use the argument that has been
implicitely generated.
</p>
<p>This can be quite funny looking and confusing at first.
This concept can be best grokked by understanding the
stack-based operations that are actually happening to build
this patch.
</p>
<p>Using postfix notation as seen in Forths and Forth-like
languages, the patch above can be realized in the following
way:
</p>
<pre><code>440 6 sine 440 add 0.5 sine</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This can be read left-to-right:
</p>
<p>440 and 6 are pushed to the stack.
</p>
<p>sine pops 6 and 440, computes a sample, and pushes it on
the stack.
</p>
<p>440 is pushed to the stack.
</p>
<p>add pops 440 and the sine sample, adds them together, and
pushes the result onto the stack.
</p>
<p>0.5 is pushed onto the stack.
</p>
<p>A sine function pops the 2 items off the stack and computes
the sine that gets heard.
</p>
<p>Going back to LIL, zz tells a function to pop the last item
off the sndkit stack and use that as an argument. Note that
zz only works with sndkit nodes and things working with the
sndkit stack. It is not a part of LIL!
</p>

<h2>Stack Operations</h2>

<p>It was mentioned in the previous section that under the hood
sndkit works using a stack. A few stack operations have been
exposed to LIL.
</p>
<p>The most common stack operation used <code>dup</code>, which duplicates
the last item on the stack. If the item is a signal (it
typically is), it will efficiently make a copy of this
signal so it can be used as an input for another unit
generator.
</p>
<p>The following code below is a patch of subtractive sawtooth
oscillator being fed into a delay line. The <code>dup</code> operation
here makes a copy of the saw (<a href="/sndkit/blep">blsaw</a>) and
feeds it into the delay line with feedback
(<a href="/sndkit/vardelay">vardelay</a>).
</p>
<pre><code># create a trigger signal
metro 0.5

# feed signal into envelope generator
env zz 0.001 0.01 0.1

# create saw oscillator at middle C
blsaw [mtof 60]
butlp zz 800

# multiply envelope and saw
mul zz zz

# reduce gain a bit to prevent clipping

mul zz 0.7

# make a copy of the dry signal
dup

# process dry signal with delay line and filter it
vardelay zz 0.5 0.75 1.0
butlp zz 300

# add dry and wet signal together
add zz zz

# write output to WAV file
wavout zz "test.wav"

# compute 10 seconds of audio
computes 10</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>The <code>drop</code> operation will drop the last item of the stack.
Here it is being used below to discard one of the channels
of the stereo reverb processor <a href="/sndkit/bigverb">bigverb</a>. <code>dup</code>is also being called twice here. Once to make a copy of the
dry signal, and then again for the stereo inputs for
the reverb.
</p>
<pre><code># create an LFO at 0.2hz
sine 0.2 1

# scale the LFO to be between 250-400hz
biscale zz 250 400

# feed scaled LFO into frequency of sawtooth oscillator
blsaw zz

# filter the sound and scale it
butlp zz 800
mul zz 0.3

# make a copy of the dry signal
dup
# copy the signal for mono-&gt;stereo inputs
dup

# process stereo signal using bigverb
bigverb zz zz 0.93 10000

# drop one of the outputs (right channel)
drop

# scale the remaining channel
mul zz 0.1

# add wet and dry signals
add zz zz

# write to WAV file and compute
wavout zz "test.wav"
computes 10</pre></code>

<h2>Registers and Buffer Holding</h2>

<p>For signals that get used more than once throughout
a patch, it is best to use buffer holding and registers.
</p>
<p>Various unit generators talk to eachother by reading and
writing to small chunks of signals known as <code>buffers</code>.
Under the hood, there is a fixed number of buffers to
write to, which are managed automatically using something
called a <code>buffer pool</code>. When a signal is done using
a buffer (the signal is no longer being used), that
buffer is released. This can be process can be prevented
by manually marking the buffer. This is known as <code>holding</code>the buffer. A held buffer must be explicitely unheld when
it is done. Otherwise, the buffer will never be used
again (which can cause trouble later).
</p>
<p>To store and retrieve buffers, sndkit provides a register
system. There are a total of 16 registers available.
</p>
<p>The following example below creates a <a href="/sndkit/siren">siren</a>patch. Here, an LFO signal is being used to control filter
cutoff and frequency of a sawtooth oscillator. When the LFO
signal is created, is is held and stored in register 0 via
<code>regset</code> and <code>hold</code>. The signal can then be retrieved again
using <code>regget</code>. When it is finished, the buffer is released
using <code>unhold</code>.
</p>
<pre><code># create an LFO. hold and store in register 0
sine 0.2 1
hold zz
regset zz 0

# scale the LFO and to modulate sawtooth
biscale [regget 0] 215 430
blsaw zz
mul zz 0.5

# scale the LFO to modulate filter cutoff
biscale [regget 0] 100 1000
butlp zz zz

# unhold the LFO signal
regget 0
unhold zz
regclr 0

# write to wave
wavout zz "test.wav"
computes 10</pre></code>
