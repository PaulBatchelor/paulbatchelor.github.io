<title>Euclidean Rhythms</title>
<h1>Euclidean Rhythms</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><code>Euclidean Rhythms</code> are a very popular technique for
procedurally generating rhythmic phrases. Using only
a few numbers, one is able to procedurally construct
very interesting and well balanced rhythmic patterns.
</p>
<p>This document aims to provide an overview of what
Euclidean Rhythms are, go over some of the existing
implementations, and then produce a novel implemenation
of a Euclidean Rhythm generator.
</p>
<p>The name "Euclidean Rhythm" is a bit of a misnomer. The
algorithm is more closely based off of work by Bjorklund.
And while there are connections to be made between Euclid's
algorithm for Greatest Common Divisor and Bjorklund's
algorithm for created evenly distributed binary
sequences (this will be discussed later), it's most likely
that the "Euclidean" name was
chosen because it sounds cool, and not because of it's
relevancy to the algorithm itself.
</p>
<p>Euclidean Rhythms have sometimes been used in the context
of ethnomusicology as an algorithmic model to describe
rhythmic patterns found in various cultures. The author
urges caution with this tempting line of thinking;
reducing the music of entire cultures down to binary
terms (literally)
will lead to very unmusical (and perhaps culturally
insensitive) generalizations. In
the quest to mathematically model music,
it is all too easy to boil things down until there
is nothing of substance left.
</p>

<h2>Definition and Notation Conventions</h2>

<p>A Euclidean Rhythm sequence is often defined in terms
of the number of pulses (p) and the total number of steps
as <code>E(p, n)</code>. For example, <code>E(3,8)</code> describes a Euclidean
sequence that evenly distributes 3 pulses across 8 steps,
which would look like <code>10010010</code> in binary notation.

<h2>Previous Work and Implementations</h2>


<h3>Toussaint</h3>

<p>The concept of a "Euclidean Rhythm" was first conceived by
Toussaint in a 2005 paper titled "The Euclidean Algorithm
Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms".
In this paper, the Euclidean
Rhythm is derived from an algorithm developed by Bjorkland
that evenly distributes a set of 0-bits amongst a set of
1-bits in a binary set. Bjorkland's algorithm is compared
against Euclid's algorithm for Greatest Common Divisor,
and some similarities are pointed out. This is how the
Euclidean Rhythm got their namesake. Toussaint goes on to
connect Euclidean Rhythms various to rhytmic motifs
found in the music of various traditions and cultures.
</p>

<h3>TidalCycles</h3>

<p>Since Toussaint, the Euclidean Rhythm Generator has been
studied quite extensively. A full overview of this research
is beyond the scope of this document, but honorable mention
goes to Yaxu and the community of the live coding
language TidalCycles. Not only have they explored extending
Euclidean rhythms using operations like <code>distrib</code>, but
have also provided
<a href="https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/blob/c529f7063f111dceaba4eb7db15da74b025d82f3/test/Sound/Tidal/UITest.hs#L276-L308">corrections</a> to Touissants original work.
</p>

<h3>"The Simplest Euclidean Rhythm Generator"</h3>

<p>A popular implementation of a Euclidean Rhythm generator
comes from an article from computermusicdesign.com.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190322182835/https://computermusicdesign.com/simplest-euclidean-rhythm-algorithm-explained">source</a>.
</p>
<p>This implementation, called "The Simplest Euclidean
Rhythm Generator", is an adaptation of a Max patch found
on the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190322182835/https://cycling74.com/forums/using-euclideanbjorklund-algorithm-for-rhythm-generation-purely-in-max/">cycling74 Max/MSP forum</a>, originally posted by user 11olsen.
</p>
<p>The algorithm in the article was described in pseudocode.
Directly translated to C, it would look something
like this:
</p>
<pre><code>void euclid_simple(int p, int n)
{
    int bucket;
    int i;

    bucket = 0;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        int pulse;
        pulse = 0;
        bucket += p;

        if (bucket &gt;= n) {
            bucket -= n;
            pulse = 1;
        } else {
            pulse = 0;
        }

        printf("%d", pulse);
    }

    printf("\n");
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This algorithm makes use of an accumulator <code>bucket</code>,
increasing by the number of pulses. This value gets
wrapped around to be within the bounds of the total number
of steps. As it turns out, this accumulator/wraparound
approach produces the even distribution of beats that defines
a euclidean rhythm pattern.
</p>
<p>The problem with this algorithm is that the sequence
always starts on a "0" instead of a "1", which isn't
ideal for musical purposes. This can remedied by
introducing a new variable called "rotate" which adds
an offset and shifts the starting position of the sequence:
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcdefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>uint32_t sk_euclid_simple(int p, int n, int r);</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This version of the algorithm adds a rotation variable
<code>r</code>. Instead of printing to standard output, this algorithm
stores the sequence as bits inside of an integer. Some
of the logic has been changed a bit too. The if/else
statement has been removed and replaced with equivalent
logic. Instead of using subtraction, a modulo operation
has been used to more clearly show the wraparound
(it's worth noting that the subtraction operation is
typically faster than a modulo operation though).
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>uint32_t sk_euclid_simple(int p, int n, int r)
{
    int bucket;
    int i;
    uint32_t out;

    out = 0;

    if (n &gt; 32) return 0;

    bucket = 0;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        int pulse;
        int bitpos;

        bitpos = (i + r) % n;
        bucket += p;
        pulse = bucket &gt;= n;
        bucket %= n;

        out |= (pulse &lt;&lt; bitpos);
    }

    return out;
}</pre></code>

<h3>Stateless One-Liners</h3>

<p>The "Simplest Euclidean Generator" algorithm can be
condensed further into a single one-liner expression in C.
What's very neat about these is that they are stateless.
Any bit for any position can be produced on demand, and
this can be quite handy in certain situations.
</p>
<p>In addition to the number of pulses (p), the total size
of the sequence (n), and the rotation (r), the index
position (i) of the particular step to be computed is
required.
</p>
<p>One implementation comes from nonmateria from Merveilles.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcdefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>int euclid_simple_stateless(int p, int n, int r, int i);</pre></code>
<p></p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>int euclid_simple_stateless(int p, int n, int r, int i)
{
    return (((p * (i + r)) % n) + p) &gt;= n;
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Another implementation comes from xinniw on LURK, which I've
been told is based off of a PD patch by acriel.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcdefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>int euclid_simple_stateless2(int p, int n, int r, int i);</pre></code>
<p></p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>int euclid_simple_stateless2(int p, int n, int r, int i)
{
    return (p * (i + r)) % n &lt; p;
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>The two expressions are nearly equivalent. The practical
difference between them is that they require different
rotation values to get the same result.
</p>
<p>The tricky thing with these is that the rotation variable
needs to be changed for every euclidean pattern in order
for it to line up to the ideal musical representation.
As of writing, the only way these rotation values have
been found is through trial-and-error. It is possible
that there is perhaps a more automated or algorithmic
approach to finding this, but at the time of writing
no efforts have been made to look into this.
</p>

<h2>Recursive Solution</h2>

<p>While it may not as straightforward, the recursive
approach as outlined by Bjorklund still seems to be
the best approach for producing Euclidean Rhythm patterns.
</p>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>The Bjorklund approach to generating a binary sequence
is usually described in terms of distributing one pattern
inside of another pattern.
</p>
<p>For example, here are the steps for producing the
sequence E(5,13):
</p>
<pre><code>1111100000000
1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
10 10 10 10 10 000
100 100 100 10 10
10010 10010 100
1001010010100</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>In these steps, the righthand pattern keeps getting
"distributed" into the lefthand pattern. The process
terminates when there's only one or none of the righthand
pattern remaining.
</p>
<p>Using some notation, these steps can expressed to more clearly
show how this process breaks down the overall sequence into
a pair of smaller bit patterns, which can be called
A (lefthand pattern) and B (righthand pattern).
</p>
<pre><code>1111100000000
5(1), 8(0)
5(10), 3(0)
3(100), 2(10)
2(10010), 1(100)
1001010010100</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>In the first iteration, the pattern is divided up into
5 1s and 8 0s. The second iteration takes this sit and
divides the pattern up into 5 10s and 3 0s. This process
repeats until there's only 1 instance of the B bitpattern.
</p>
<p>Every iteration increases the size of the bitpatterns.
Bitpattern A becomes a concatenation of previous A and
B bitpatterns, and B becomes what is leftover.
</p>
<p>Looking at the number of A and B bitpatterns, one can
begin to see some resemblances to the Euclid's GCD
algorithm. These states match the states in the GCD
algorithm: [8, 5], [5, 3], [3, 2], [2, 1].
</p>
<p>Using the introduced notation above, the euclidean
sequence E(5, 13) can be unambiguously represented as
[2(10010), 1(100)], or <a href="2, 0b10010], [1, 0b100">2, 0b10010], [1, 0b100</a>. An
algorithm to generate a euclidean sequence using
this convention is shown using the pseudocode below:
</p>
<pre><code>euclid(p, n):
    a = 1
    n_a = p

    b = 0
    n_b = n - p

    while n_b &gt; 1:
        c = a + b
        d = a

        if n_a &gt; n_b:
            t = n_a
            n_a = n_b
            n_b = t - n_b
        else:
            t = n_b
            n_a = n_a
            n_b = t - n_a
            d = b

        a = c
        b = d

   return [n_a, a], [n_b, b]</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>It's interesting to note the resemblance to Euclids
subtraction based GCD algorithm. This pseudocode is based
off the one found on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#Implementations">wikipedia</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>gcd(a, b):
    while a != b:
        if a &gt; b:
            a = a - b
        else:
            b = b - a
    return a</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>(The author notes that
he did not see this GCD algorithm until <b>after</b> he wrote
the pseudocode for this program.)
</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>With the algorithm fully described in the previous
section, an implementation can now be done in C.
</p>

<h4>Appending Bitpatterns</h4>

<p>In the pseudo-code, the operation in charge of appending
two patterns together was casually represented using
addition. <code>A+B</code> yields a concatentation of the
two patterns, yielding pattern <code>AB</code>. Unfortunately, this
append operation is not so elegant to do in C.
</p>
<p>Before creating the append operation itself, a data type
will be defined for a bitpattern, called
<code>sk_euclid_bitpat</code>:
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;typedefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>typedef struct sk_euclid_bitpat sk_euclid_bitpat;</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This contains a 16-bit integer storing the pattern
as binary bits called <code>pat</code>, and the size of the pattern
in bits called <code>nbits</code>. There is also another value
called <code>npats</code>, which is a value that stores the
number of times this pattern appears in the sequence.
This is used later in algorithm when it splits the larger
bitpattern into two smaller bitpatterns.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;structs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>struct sk_euclid_bitpat {
    uint16_t pat;
    uint8_t nbits;
    uint8_t npats;
};</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>The append operation appends in-place, turning
the data in bitpattern A into AB. bitpattern B is
left unchanged.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;static_funcdefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>static void append(sk_euclid_bitpat *a, sk_euclid_bitpat *b);</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Patterns are stored in ascending bit order. That is to say,
the first item in the pattern is stored in the first
bit of the number, second item in second bit, third
item in third bit, etc. An append operation takes the
B bitpattern, left shifts it, then ORs it into the A
pattern.
</p>
<p>The size, kept track of in <code>nbits</code>, is also updated.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>static void append(sk_euclid_bitpat *a, sk_euclid_bitpat *b)
{
    a-&gt;pat |= b-&gt;pat &lt;&lt; a-&gt;nbits;
    a-&gt;nbits += b-&gt;nbits;
}</pre></code>

<h4>Euclidean Pattern Generation</h4>

<p>With the append operation implemented, the rest of
the Euclidean Sequence generator can be implemented.
</p>
<p>When given Euclidean sequence <code>E(p, n)</code>,
<code>sk_euclid_pattern</code> will return generated binary sequence
stored inside of an unsigned long integer.
</p>
<p>It is optimistically assumed that an unsigned long will
be at least 32 bits long in size on the machine this
is compiled on.
Any value of <code>n</code> larger than this will return 0.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcdefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>unsigned long sk_euclid_pattern(int p, int n);</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This is a two step process. The first step performs
the division of the two patterns until the number of
B patterns is less than or equal to 1, as seen in
the pseudocode previously. The second step involves
taking the bitpattern representation and "rendering" it
to bits inside of a long integer.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>unsigned long sk_euclid_pattern(int p, int n)
{
    sk_euclid_bitpat a, b;
    unsigned long out;
    int i, k;
    int bitpos;

    if (n &lt; 1 || n &gt; 32) return 0;

    a.pat = 1;
    a.nbits = 1;
    a.npats = p;

    b.pat = 0;
    b.nbits = 1;
    b.npats = n - p;

    while (b.npats &gt; 1) {
        uint16_t prev_pat;
        uint8_t prev_nbits;

        if (a.npats &gt; b.npats) {
            uint8_t tmp;

            tmp = a.npats;
            a.npats = b.npats;
            b.npats = tmp - b.npats;

            prev_pat = a.pat;
            prev_nbits = a.nbits;
        } else {
            b.npats = b.npats - a.npats;
            prev_pat = b.pat;
            prev_nbits = b.nbits;
        }

        append(&a, &b);

        b.pat = prev_pat;
        b.nbits = prev_nbits;
    }

    out = 0;

    /* write bitpatterns to bits */

    bitpos = 0;
    for (k = 0; k &lt; a.npats; k++) {
        for (i = 0; i &lt; a.nbits; i++) {
            int bit;
            bit = (a.pat & (1 &lt;&lt; i)) &gt; 0;
            out |= (1 &lt;&lt; bitpos) * bit;
            bitpos++;
        }
    }

    for (k = 0; k &lt; b.npats; k++) {
        for (i = 0; i &lt; b.nbits; i++) {
            int bit;
            bit = (b.pat & (1 &lt;&lt; i)) &gt; 0;
            out |= (1 &lt;&lt; bitpos) * bit;
            bitpos++;
        }
    }

    return out;
}</pre></code>

<h2>An Opinionated Euclidean Rhythm Generator</h2>

<p>With the algorithm for producing a Euclidean sequence
established, it is now onto implementing a Euclidean
generator that can be used to control musical sound.
</p>
<p>There is more than one approach for designing such
a sequencer. This one will aim to be simple
and musically intuitive.
</p>

<h3>Design Opinions</h3>

<p>While most DSP algorithms on sndkit are pretty cut-and-dry
in terms of "interface" design (stuff goes in, stuff
goes out, here are the parameters), this one has some
wiggle room and subjectivity.
</p>
<p>So, here are some opinions I have about euclidean
rhythm generators:
</p>
<p>Euclidean Rhythm Generators should always be linear.
They shouldn't go backwards or skip. They should only
step forward and then loop back to the beginning at the
end. From an implementation standpoint, this means
position tracking will happen internally, rather than
being exposed as external parameter. This makes the
interface easier to use, at the cost of sacrifcing a bit of
granular control.
</p>
<p>Changing the total step size mid-phrase is unmusical, as
it abitrarily changes the meter (and the pattern) before
the end of the bar which doesn't make sense.
From an implementation perspective, it's also ambiguous
how to handle that. Ideally, changes should only happen
at the start of the sequence...
</p>
<p>...but this behavior will be allowed anyways. Only
allowing changes to happen at the start of a sequence
could potentially make the sequencer sound broken and
laggy. Instantaneous changes provide a better user
experience.
</p>
<p>Changing the number of pulses mid-phrase is fine: all
this is doing is changing the pattern without changing
meter. It encouraged that changes happen roughly once
per phrase on average, and towards the beginning of the
phrase as well.
</p>
<p>While it is theoretically possible to to have a Euclidean
rhythm pattern of any size, things stop being musically
interesting for sizes greater than 32. 32 is a
convenient limit to use because it allows all sequences
to fit inside of a 32-bit integer.
</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>This rhythm generator, called <code>euclid</code>, can be thought of as
a kind of clock filter. A clock signal goes in, such
as one produced by <a href="/sndkit/metro">metro</a>, and some kind of
trigger signal comes out which makes a Euclidean rhythm
pattern <code>E(n, p)</code>.
</p>

<h4>sk_euclid C Struct</h4>

<p>The data for <code>euclid</code> is contained in a struct called
<code>sk_euclid</code>.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;typedefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>typedef struct sk_euclid sk_euclid;</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p><code>pos</code> is the sequence position.
</p>
<p><code>pulses</code> is <code>p</code>, or the number of pulses in the pattern.
</p>
<p><code>len</code> is <code>n</code>, or the total size of the pattern.
</p>
<p><code>bits</code> is a long integer value storing the generated
pattern.
</p>
<p>The <code>changed</code> variable is a flag set any time the
<code>pulses</code> or <code>len</code> variables are changed.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;structs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>struct sk_euclid {
    int pos;
    int pulses;
    int len;
    unsigned long bits;
    int changed;
};</pre></code>

<h4>Initialization</h4>

<p>An instance of <code>sk_euclid</code> is initialized
with <code>sk_euclid_init</code>.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcdefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>void sk_euclid_init(sk_euclid *e);</pre></code>
<p></p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>void sk_euclid_init(sk_euclid *e)
{
    sk_euclid_pulses(e, 1);
    sk_euclid_length(e, 4);
    e-&gt;changed = 0;
    e-&gt;bits = 0;
    e-&gt;pos = 0;
}</pre></code>

<h4>Parameters</h4>

<p><code>sk_euclid_pulses</code> sets the total number of
pulses.
</p>
<p><code>sk_euclid_length</code> sets the length of the pattern.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcdefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>void sk_euclid_pulses(sk_euclid *e, int p);
void sk_euclid_length(sk_euclid *e, int n);</pre></code>
<p></p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>void sk_euclid_pulses(sk_euclid *e, int p)
{
    if (p != e-&gt;pulses && p &gt; 0 && p &lt;= 32) {
        e-&gt;pulses = p;
        e-&gt;changed = 1;
    }
}

void sk_euclid_length(sk_euclid *e, int n)
{
    if (n != e-&gt;len && n &gt; 1 && n &lt;= 32) {
        e-&gt;len = n;
        e-&gt;changed = 1;
    }
}</pre></code>

<h4>Tick Function</h4>

<p>A single sample of audio is produced
with <code>sk_euclid_tick</code>. This takes in as input
a trigger signal <code>trig</code>. The trigger signal will be
returned based on the state of the Euclidean
sequence.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcdefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>SKFLT sk_euclid_tick(sk_euclid *e, SKFLT trig);</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>In many ways, this generator very much resembles a
classic rhythmic step sequencer. The difference being
that the step sequence itself is procedurally generated,
and the length can be variable.
</p>
<p>As mentioned before, changing the total length in the
middle of a phrase is musically undefined behavior with
more than one approach to handle it. The approach chosen
here is to have the sequencer position wrap around if
it is out of bounds.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;funcs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>SKFLT sk_euclid_tick(sk_euclid *e, SKFLT trig)
{
    SKFLT out;

    out = 0;

    if (trig) {

        /* update pattern if needed */

        if (e-&gt;changed) {
