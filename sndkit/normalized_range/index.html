<title>Normalized Range</title>
<h1>Normalized Range</h1>
<p>In <code>sndkit</code>, a <code>normalized range</code> is any real number within
the inclusive range 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>Normalized ranges are ideal ways to abstract away units when
you don't want to think about them.
</p>
<p>Usually, values in a normalized range are destined to be
<a href="/sndkit/scale">rescaled later</a>, such as <a href="/sndkit/oscf">table lookup oscillators</a>.
</p>
<p>In IEEE floating point, there are sometimes some numerical
advantages to keeping things in a smaller range, as values
in this range have more equidistance spacing compared to
using relatively larger values. This spacing is referred
to as the magnitude of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place">unit in last place, or "ulp"</a>.
More information about the nuances of floating point
precision can be found in <code>Physically Based Rendering</code> by
Pharr, Jakob, and Humphreys in Chapter 3.9 (Managing
Rounding Error).
