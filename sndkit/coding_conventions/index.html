<h1>Coding Conventions</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This document aims to outline some of the various
coding conventions and patterns used in the
sndkit <a href="#">algorithm</a>. This can be used
as a guide to help read the programs written here.
</p>

<h2>Literate Programming</h2>

<p>Each algorithm is written using a paradigm known as
<code>literate programming</code>. In a very small nutshell,
it is a technique that allows programmer
to melt natural language structure with computer logic
structure. In sndkit, algorithms are written in
org markup using org-mode. Between the blocks of text
are noweb style named code blocks, following the conventions
of org-babel. From there, the org documents can either be
rendered to HTML (a process known as <code>weaving</code>), or
be used to generate C code readable by a C compiler (a
process known as <code>tangling</code>).
</p>
<p>While emacs and org-mode are very conveniently used to
write the algorithms,
<b>emacs is not a dependency for using sndkit</b>.
</p>
<p>For tangling to C code, sndkit uses a custom org tangler
called <code>worgle</code>, written in ANSI C. It is included with
the sndkit distribution. For weaving into HTML, a tool
called weewiki. weewiki is not included with sndkit. You'll
need to install that program separately in order to render
the HTML pages locally.
</p>

<h2>Algorithm Overview</h2>

<p>At the start of every algorithm is some kind of overview.
This provides a few short sentences on what the algorithm
does, and maybe something about the inputs and outputs.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, some upfront elaboration is needed. This happens
in sections afterwards.
</p>

<h2>Tangled Files</h2>

<p>Typically, a sndkit algorithm will tangle out to a single C
and header file, foo.c and foo.h. The declarations
themselves are in a section usually called <code>tangled files</code>.
</p>
<p>Algorithms in sndkit designed to be as self-contained as
possible. It should be possible to use the files by
themselves without anything else from sndkit. This makes
it easy to extract things from sndkit in other projects and
use only what is needed.
</p>
<p>The downside of this is that yes, there is sometimes
redudant code and functionality. This is an acceptable
tradeoff for now, as decomposability of sndkit is an
important pillar in the design philosophy of this
project.
</p>

<h2>Named Codeblocks</h2>

<p>Literate programs, such as the ones made in sndkit, are
composed of named code blocks. Blocks are chunks of text
that can have blocks nested inside of them. Blocks can
also be appended to, which can be a useful way to
dynamically add code.
</p>
<p>At this point, sndkit program structures follow a pretty
predictable structure, and often use the same conventions
for named code blocks.
</p>

<h3>C and Header Tangle Blocks</h3>

<p>A sndkit algorithm tangles to two files: a C and a header
file. These are considered to be two top-level named blocks.
For an algorithm foo, these are named foo.c and foo.h.
Inside these blocks contain all the other blocks.
</p>
<p>What makes these blocks special are that they 
explicitely tell the tangler to write to files.
</p>

<h3>funcs</h3>

<p>All C functions are appended to a named code block called
<code>funcs</code>. This is included inside of the top-level C file
block.
</p>

<h3>funcdefs</h3>

<p>All public function declarations/definitions are appended to
a codeblock called <code>funcdefs</code>, and are included in the
top-level header file block.
</p>
<p>In a literate program, a
<code>funcdefs</code> block is usually closely followed by a
corresponding <code>func</code> block.
</p>

<h3>static_funcdefs</h3>

<p>A static function definitions/declarations are done in
a block called <code>static_funcdefs</code>. This is included towards
the beginning of the C file code block.
</p>

<h3>typedefs</h3>

<p>Public facing structs in C use type definitions, or
typedefs. All typedefs are appended to the <code>typedefs</code> block,
contained in the header file code block.
</p>

<h3>structs</h3>

<p>Structs used by a particular algorithm are defined in the
<code>structs</code> codeblock, contained in the header file codeblock.
By default, these are made opaque, but can be exposed by
defining the <code>SK_FOO_PRIV</code> macro.
</p>

<h3>macros</h3>

<p>macros can be defined in a codeblock called <code>macros</code>.
Usually these are defined with local scope in the C file
rather than the header file. If there is a different
between local macros in the C file and public ones in
the header, use <code>local_macros</code> and <code>macros</code>.
</p>

<h3>init</h3>

<p>A very common design pattern is to have some function
that initializes data in a struct called <code>sk_foo_init</code>.
Using codeblocks, one can add and initialize variables
in a piecemeal. Variable declarations can be declared in
one block. Initialization can happen in a block called
<code>init</code>. For a an algorithm with struct <code>sk_foo</code>, contents
inside of that struct usually would use a code block
called <code>foo</code>.
</p>

<h2>SKFLT</h2>

<p>Floating point types use a macro called <code>SKFLT</code>, and by
default this is set to be <code>float</code>. Every DSP algorithm
has a way to explicitely define this if it hasn't been
previously defined.
</p>

<h2>Function Naming Conventions</h2>

<p>Sndkit algorithms share a common set of things
they do like initialization, and computing a sample
of audio, or setting a variable. Below are a set of
the most common functions, and the names used to describe
them.
</p>

<h3>tick</h3>

<p>When a DSP algorithm computes a single sample of audio,
it is called a <code>tick</code>, and is usually called <code>sk_foo_tick</code>.
If a tick function takes any audio-rate signals, these
are provided as arguments to the function.
</p>
<p>Most DSP algorithms in sndkit are mono, so the functions
will simply return one <code>SKFLT</code>. For multiple outputs,
the values are stored in pointers at the end of the
function. For stereo processors such as <a href="/sndkit/bigverb">bigverb</a>,
this is the one time where single-letter
camel case variable names are used, such as
<code>inL</code>, <code>inR</code>, <code>outL</code>, or <code>outR</code>.
</p>

<h3>init</h3>

<p>For intializing data in a struct, the word <code>init</code> is used,
as in <code>sk_foo_init</code>. The first argument to this function
is the struct itself, which expects to be <code>sk_foo</code>.
Following this is the sampling rate <code>sr</code>, if needed. Any
other init-time variables are supplied after.
</p>
<p><code>init</code> should only be used to initialize and zero out
data. For dynamic memory allocation for things like
delay lines, <code>del</code> and <code>new</code> conventions are used.
</p>

<h3>del and new</h3>

<p>For algorithms that require dynamic memory allocation, such
as <a href="/sndkit/bigverb">bigverb</a>, the <code>del</code> and <code>new</code> words are used,
as in <code>sk_foo_new</code> and <code>sk_foo_del</code>. A <code>new</code> function
will allocate and initialize a new instance of <code>sk_foo</code>.
The <code>del</code> function will clean up all memory, as well
the instance itself.
</p>

<h3>setting and getting parameters</h3>

<p>It is the convention to use setters and getters
rather than manipulate variables directly.
</p>
<p>When in doubt, for parameter <code>param</code>, use <code>sk_foo_param_set</code>and <code>sk_foo_param_get</code>. To get and set the parameters.
However, it is typical for setters drop the <code>set</code>, as in
<code>sk_foo_param</code> for terseness, as it is understood that it is
a setter.
