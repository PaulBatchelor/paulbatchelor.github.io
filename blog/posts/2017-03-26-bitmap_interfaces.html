<h1>Simple Musical Interfaces for Sporth using OpenGL bitmaps</h1>
<p>2017-03-26</p>
<h2>Pondering</h2>
<p>Lately, I've been thinking about graphical user interfaces in music. 
Not having them for so long has given me ample to time to question what they
represent.  I've avoided including them in my sonic ecosystem of software. 
They are just hard to do well. Libraries for handling graphics like GTK and QT 
are large and would add a great deal of complexity to my work. And even if you get the
technical stuff figured out, you still are stuck making things look and feel
good. It's a set of challenges I'm just not sure about investing the time in
solving.</p>
<p>More importantly, I avoid graphical utilities out of principle. Now that
I build most of my tools, I often ask myself "do I really need it?". After years
of working with text-based highly modular environments like Csound, and then 
building Sporth, many graphical interfaces feel restrictive and limiting for
sound design. Indeed, even when I was knee-deep in commercial software like 
ProTools or Reaper, I found using the "easy-to-use" mouse-based interfaces to 
be tedious and sluggish, especially with the rise of high-quality touchscreens.
Many widgets common in DAWs are really skeumorphic representations of analog 
hardware, designed for a generation of technophobic audio engineers. Let's be 
honest here: virtual knobs make no sense. </p>
<p>Despite all this, I'm coming around to the fact that there is indeed <em>something</em>
to be said about having a visual interface of sorts. I'm just not quite sure
what that means for me yet. </p>
<p>This past week, I've taken some small steps into
the frightening world of graphical user interfaces, building some small graphics
utilities based on interfaces I've enjoyed working with in the past. They are 
implemented as simple Sporth plugins, which generate simple signals to be used
within a Sporth patch. Not only are they simple, but they are also small. I've
opted to use glBitmaps to draw the interfaces onscreen. To my surprise, they 
have pretty fast to draw, leaving plenty of CPU room for audio.</p>
<h2>Seq16</h2>
<p><img src="/res/blog/bitmap_interfaces/seq16.png" alt="Seq16" /></p>
<p>The first thing I built was <a href="http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/seq16">Seq16</a>.</p>
<p>Seq16 is a 4-channel, 16-step sequencer. I designed this to make it easy to
build drum loops. Seq16 is driven by a sample-accurate clock signal generated
by Sporth. Each channel generates a gate signal, stored in a Sporth table
that Seq16 creates. These signals can be mapped in many ways to trigger 
sounds in Sporth. </p>
<p>Seq16 has the ability to save/load pattern data in the internal <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/Soundpipe/blob/master/lib/spa/spa.c">Soundpipe
audio (SPA) format</a>
This has proven to be very convenient so far. However, I plan on changing
the format to be text-based rather than a binary format.</p>
<h2>Tracker3</h2>
<p><img src="/res/blog/bitmap_interfaces/tracker3.png" alt="Tracker3" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/tracker3">Tracker3</a>
is a 3-channel, 64-step sequencer. </p>
<p>This is designed specifically to quickly build up small melodies and monophonic 
instruments. I am proud to say that is may be the stupidest music tracker in 
existence. No effect columns, no instruments, no patterns. Nothin. 
Just three channels, choice of note and octave, and 64 steps. </p>
<p>Similar to Seq16, Tracker3 stores signals for each of it's 3 channels via
Sporth tables.
Each channel has two components: a note component and a gate component. The
note component stores the current pitch as a midi note number, the gate is a binary
signal indicating if the note is on/off. These signals can be fed into oscillators
and envelopes to drive monophonic instruments. </p>
<p>Building on top of Seq16, Tracker3 saves/loads/reloads patterns using a minimal 
version of <a href="/proj/runt">Runt</a>. The advantage of this is that sequences can be
edited in a text editor in addition to the tracker sequencer. </p>
