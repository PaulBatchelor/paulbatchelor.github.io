<h1>Weekly Update 7: Stories and Maps</h1>
<p>2023-07-30</p>
<h2>Gestlings have Narrative Now</h2>
<p>This week I found myself thinking about story and maps
for the <a href="/wiki/gestlings">Gestlings Project</a>. I wanted
to about characters and dialogue too, but it ended up
making more sense to think about these narrative
elements first. I'm not really much of a writer of fiction,
so this was new territory for me.</p>
<p>As of this week, the Gestlings have a beginning, middle, and end.
There's also now an established set of
core "maps" of the Gestling world, which will become
fleshed out and populated with Gestlings. The Gestlings
will then have things to say in that space, and this is
where the sound design actually occurs. One could almost
say I'm doing "level design" and "NPCs".</p>
<p>When I first thought up the term "Gestlings", the idea
was to make a modest collection of compositional etudes
centered around the technique of <a href="/wiki/gesture">Gesture Synthesis</a>,
similar to how the <a href="/sporthlings">Sporthlings</a> were a collection
of studies for <a href="/wiki/sporth">Sporth</a>. Now, these "etudes"
have a <a href="/gestlings/beginning">Creation Myth</a>. Clearly,
I've lost control of the situation.</p>
<h2>The Premise</h2>
<p>As of today, here is the premise for Gestlings:</p>
<p>You have died. Under usual circumstances, you'd have been
sent off to the Usual Places. However, due to the cosmic
equivalent of a clerical error, your consciousness wakes
up on what it perceives as a moving train, very far from
home, and even further from that thing you called "reality".
The next stop? Cauldronia, a small celestial body that
is the homeworld of the Gestlings. It's probably going to
be a while before they correct this mistake, so you might
as well take a look around and explore.</p>
<h2>Scribbles</h2>
<p><img src="/res/weekly/scribbles_setup.jpg" alt="my scribbling setup" /></p>
<p>I don't consider myself all the coordinated using pen and
paper. I've had infamously bad handwriting all my life.
Despite this, I find it helpful to scribble my thoughts
down using ink rather than use a computer. It seems to flow
better.</p>
<p>This week there was a lot of scribbling, and I've
posted some of them below. I'll do my best
to get out of the way and let them speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I've redacted some parts that I consider to be "spoilers".</p>

<h2>Bonus: Ripples on the Monome Grid Zero</h2>
<p>I treated myself to a monome grid zero. I built a little
program to test out the LEDs, and it turned into an interface
for a musical instrument:</p>
