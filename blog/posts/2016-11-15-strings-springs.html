<h1>Springs, Strings, and 3d Printed Things</h1>
<p>2016-11-15</p>
<p>These past few weeks have been spent on my Stanford 250a project. In
particular, I was experimenting with the various ways I could build
the rectrable string interface, by far the most challenging aspect of
this project by my estimates!</p>
<p>Displayed below are pictures in mostly chronological order, documenting
my progress thus far.</p>
<h2>Fit tests</h2>
<p><a href="

<p>My adventures with 3d printing began with making fit tests for my Griffin knob.
I wanted to be able to have a snug fit for the Griffin, hence the trial and 
error. As it turns out, measurements for this were fractions of a millimeter. 
The progress for the fit tests can be seen right to left:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first chip printed had an inner hole 6mm in diameter, a measurement I got from
the digital calipers in the max lab. This turned out to be too small in practice.</li>
<li>The second chip printed had the hole bumped up to 7mm. This proved to be
far too loose.</li>
<li>The third chip had an inner diameter of 6.5mm. Still too large...</li>
<li>The winning diameter ended up being 6.25mm, which provided a very 
tight and snug fit.</li>
<li>The final chip had the thickness increased from 2mm to 4mm. This made it much
easier to pop off the encoder</li>
</ul>
<h2>3d-printing the Spool</h2>

<p>The next step involved 3d-printing a duplicate of the spool. My very first
attempt at printing this was a naive failure; I tried to print the spool 
in one go. Following the advice of Nando, my next iteration involved printing
two parts which could snap together. This is displayed above. </p>
<p>You will notice that the slot of the 3d-printed spool is flipped the wrong
way. Later, I would also discover that the spool is also too small.</p>
<h2>Uncoiling the Spring</h2>
<p><a href="
/res/blog/strings_springs/large/spring_unwound.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/strings_springs/small/spring_unwound.jpg" alt="Unwinding..." /></a></p>
<p>Despite the mistakes I made with the initial spool, I went ahead and started
transferring the flat spring to it. This meant uncoiling the spring, as seen
in the picture above. Once uncoiled, the spring had to be wound up again and
placed inside the new spool. This turned out to be a <em>very</em> tedious operation.
I did it enough times to have a system made for it, involving the vice and 
a set of needlenose pliers.</p>

<p>See this picture above? It turns out that the tab needs to be facing the other
way in order for it to work with the tape measure. Uncoil. Again. </p>
<h2>Vice Test</h2>
<p><a href="
/res/blog/strings_springs/large/vicetest.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/strings_springs/small/vicetest.jpg" alt="Testing with vice" /></a></p>
<p>After the coil was placed in the spring, I began trying to action seeing if
the coiling mechanisms could still work in the new spool using the vice. 
It worked! Later on, I would go back and print a larger spool which made it 
work a lot smoother.</p>
<h2>Frankensteining the components</h2>
<p><a href="
/res/blog/strings_springs/large/spool_comp.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/strings_springs/small/spool_comp.jpg" alt="Alignment issues" /></a></p>
<p>With the fit tests created and the spool created, the next course of action
involved printing what I actually needed: a hybrid of both. The initial
frakenstein creation can be seen above. You will notice that I attempted
to correct the flipped slot issues, only to have it be misaligned still. The
diameter was still also the wrong size.</p>
<p>Both of these issues (and more!) were fixed in the next iteration, displayed 
below:</p>
<p><a href="
/res/blog/strings_springs/large/encoder_spool.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/strings_springs/small/encoder_spool.jpg" alt="Spool and encoder" /></a></p>
<h2>A loose layout</h2>
<p><a href="
/res/blog/strings_springs/large/loose_layout_2.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/strings_springs/small/loose_layout_2.jpg" alt="Loose layout" /></a></p>
<p>The picture above was a loose layout of what my pullstring prototype 
could possibly look like, based on illustrations I made. The wood and pipes
were found around the lab.</p>
<h2>The final proof-of-concept</h2>
<p><a href="
/res/blog/strings_springs/large/prototype.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/strings_springs/small/prototype.jpg" alt="final POC proto" /></a></p>
<p>The final proof-of-concept is displayed above. It is made using the 3d printed
components I made, scrap wood, gaffers tape, and a pipe for weight. </p>
<p>The rectractable pull string is fully functional, the rotation of the spool
translates to the rotary encoder, which can in turn be plugged into a computer
and interpreted by a computer program like Sporth. </p>
<p>Sasha and others were unsure how this proof of concept would appear in the 
final project. The pull string is meant to be played horizontally like a bow. 
The blurry picture below demonstrates this:</p>
