<h1>What is Polysporth?</h1>
<p>Polysporth is a Sporth unit generator for handling multiple instances of Sporth. It's  interface
is written in s7 scheme. It was created to solve two major shortcomings in Sporth:
events and polyphony. </p>
<h2>Compiling polysporth</h2>
<p>To compile polysporth, simply enable the "BUILD_POLYSPORTH" parameter in config.mk.
No extra dependencies should be needed. Be warned though... s7 scheme takes
a few moments to compile since it's an entire programming language! </p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Polysporth is called as a unit generator from Sporth, where it takes the 
following arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>arg 0 is a trigger which calls a function in scheme defined as "run"</li>
<li>arg 1 is a clock (typically should be a metro or dmetro)</li>
<li>arg 2 is the number of sporth instances to create</li>
<li>arg 3 is the input ftable (which you create)</li>
<li>arg 4 is the output ftable (created by polysporth)</li>
<li>arg 5 is the name of the scheme file</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of pushing values to the stack, polysporth writes its audio the
to the output ftable. Each position of the ftable corresponds to a particular
instance of Sporth, called a <em>sporthlet</em>. </p>
<p>Input signals can be sent to the sporth instances via the input table. </p>
<h2>Scheme</h2>
<p>The main interface of polysporth is controlled via the s7 dialect of scheme. s7
scheme is included in the Sporth codebase, so there are no extra dependencies. </p>
<p>Optionally, polysporth looks for a scheme function called "run". This is the callback 
that runs every time the trigger signal is non-zero.</p>
<h2>Sporthlets</h2>
<p>Sporthlets are individual instances of Sporth inside Polysporth. When you start 
polysporth, you must allocate how many you plan to use ahead of time. You cannot 
change this number without restarting Sporth. </p>
<p>Once inside scheme, you are able to handle all the individual instances of sporth,
called sporthlets. Each sporthlet has it's own unique id from 0 to N, and can be 
controlled individually or in a group for polyphonic instances. </p>
<p>Sporthlets can be turned on or off. when they are off, they are not computed.</p>
<p>Sporthlets can be scheduled in a note-list fashion, similar to languages like
Csound, CLM, or Music V. The only difference is that the unit of time is in beats
(via the clock) as a positive integer. You can also provide up to 8 floating
point values as a list for parameters, accessible as an ftable called "args".</p>
<h2>Note Events</h2>
<p>Polysporth supports the concept of a note event. Notes in polysporth are very 
similar in concept to a Csound notelist. </p>
<p>A note event constsist of:</p>
<p>group start
group end
starting time (beats)
duration (beats)
arguments (up to 8 floats, can be an empty list)</p>
<p>Different from Csound scores, Sporthlet note events also have a concept of <em>groups</em>.
Groups are a range of sporthlet ids. When the note runs, it will find the next available
free sporthlet in that list and play that. Voice groups can be thought of as a low level
implementation of Csound instrument ids, used for spawning multiple instances of the 
same sporth instrument.  Monophonic voices will have matching start and end for their group. </p>
<p>Here is a trivial example of polysporth note events. The sporth code looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;in&quot; 10 zeros
0
(60 120 2 * / dmetro dup 0 &quot;in&quot; tset)
9 &quot;in&quot; &quot;out&quot; &quot;test.scm&quot; polysporth
0 &quot;out&quot; tget 
1 &quot;out&quot; tget +
2 &quot;out&quot; tget +</code></pre>
<p>The scheme code looks this</p>
<pre><code>(define sine &quot;0 'args' tget mtof 0.1 sine&quot;)
(ps-eval 0 sine)
(ps-eval 1 sine)
(ps-eval 2 sine)

(ps-noteblock-begin)
(ps-note 0 2 0 4 '(69.0))
(ps-note 0 2 2 4 '(71.0))
(ps-note 0 2 4 4 '(73.0))
(ps-noteblock-end)
</code></pre>
<p>Some notes (get it?) on this:
<ul>
<li><em>ps-eval</em> evaluates a sporth string to a sporthlet number</li>
<li>notes are defined inside a noteblock </li>
<li><em>ps-note</em> takes for arguments a range of sporthlet voices (first
2 arguments), a start time, and a duration.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Metanotes</h2>
<p>Metanotes are note events that call lambda functions instead of turning on
sporthlets. Metanotes can be used to store groups of note events for organization.<br />  </p>
<p>Using our previous sporth code, here is a trivial example using metanotes:</p>
<pre><code>(define nt (lambda (i start dur args) 
    (ps-note (vector-ref i 0) (vector-ref i 1) start dur args)))
   
(define meta &quot;
'saw' 4096 '0 1 4096 -1' gen_line
'sine' 4096 gen_sine
&quot;)
(define synth 
&quot;tick 0 pset 0 'args' tget 
5 1 0 'sine' osc 
0.5 * + mtof 
0.1 0 'saw' osc 
1000 butlp 
0 p 0.1 1 0.1 tenv * &quot;)

(define ins #(1 3))

(ps-eval 0 meta)

(ps-eval 1 synth)
(ps-eval 2 synth)
(ps-eval 3 synth)

(ps-noteblock-begin)
(nt ins 0 4 '(69.0))
(nt ins 2 4 '(71.0))
(nt ins 4 4 '(73.0))
(ps-noteblock-end)
</code></pre>
