<h1>Browsing Program Structure with Worgle and SQLite</h1>
<p>2019-09-02</p>
<h2>Literate Programs as Structured Data</h2>
<p>A compelling aspect of writing literate programs is that
they can be represented as structured data. In
<a href="/proj/worgle">Worgle</a>, there are two main tree
representations of the overall program structure. The woven
tree represents the document structure as a collection of
headers found in the Org markup language. The tangled tree
represents the generated code structure as a series of
named codeblocks created using the noweb syntax.</p>
<p>I always thought it would be a very powerful thing to be
able to explore literate programs as trees. As of now,
this is beginning to be possible in Worgle. Worgle has the
ability to write data to a SQLite database, which is then
queried using a program called worgmap.</p>
<h2>Extracting Data from a Worgle Literate Program</h2>
<p>Before a literate program made using Worgle can be queried,
data must first be written to an intermediate format.
I have chosen to use SQLite, as it is a robust and
mature data format that is trivial for other programs
to parse.</p>
<p>A database is generated using the "-d" flag in Worgle.
The code below generates a database from the main Worgle
org file.</p>
<pre><code> worgle -d a.db worgle.org</code></pre>
<p>The name "a.db" is the default name of the database that
Worgmap opens to query information.</p>
<p>Database write times are reasonable. My largest program
written in Worgle to-date, <a href="/proj/monolith">Monolith</a>, is
able to write a database in under half a second on my 2015
macbook pro. My GPD laptop running alpine Linux does seem
to take a few seconds. This performance difference feels
larger than I expected, even when considering the hardware
difference. Even so, it still feels manageable.</p>
<h2>Some Querying Via Worgmap</h2>
<p>Once a database is generated, it can be queried using
"get" utilities found in a program called Worgmap. The
database is a pure SQLite database, so it is possible
to just do raw SQL queries using the sqlite3 CLI. The
worgmap get interface saves a few keystrokes.</p>
<p>When worgmap is run, it is assumed the database is in
the current working directory, and that the name of the
database is named "a.db". In the future, this will be
more customizable.</p>
<p>To get a list of files from the database, run</p>
<pre><code> worgmap get filelist</code></pre>
<p>This will return the list of files tangled by Worgle:</p>
<pre><code> worgle.c
 worgle.h
 worgle_private.h</code></pre>
<p>The program <code>ffile</code> can be used to get metadata on
the file "worgle.c":</p>
<pre><code> worgmat get ffile worgle.c</code></pre>
<p>This returns the following:</p>
<pre><code> id = 2
 filename = worgle.c
 top = 1
 next_file = 29</code></pre>
<p>The <code>id</code> is the UUID associated with this resource.
<code>filename</code> is the stored filename (duh). <code>top</code> refers
to the top-level code block represented. <code>next_file</code>
is the UUID of the next file in the list.</p>
<p>To get more information on the top level block:</p>
<pre><code> worgmap get blk 1</code></pre>
<p>Which returns:</p>
<pre><code> 1 3 worgle-top</code></pre>
<p>This displays in order: the UUID (1), the UUID of the top
level segment, and the name of the block (worgle-top).
"worgle-top" is the block that contains the entire
structure of the tangled C file "worgle.c". A
tree view of this block can be printed using:</p>
<pre><code> worgmap get tree worgle-top</code></pre>
<p>The results:</p>
<pre><code> global_variables
 enums
  parse_modes
 static_function_declarations
 functions
  loadfile_localvars
  loadfile
  parser_local_variables
  parser_initialization
  getline
  parse_mode_org
  parse_mode_code
  parse_mode_begincode
   begin_the_code
  worgle_block_set_id
  worgle_file_set_id
  worgle_segment_string_set_id
  worgle_segment_reference_set_id
  worgle_init
  worgle_free
  worgle_string_init
  worgle_segment_init
  worgle_block_init
  hashmap_hasher
  worgle_file_init_id
 local_variables

   turn_on_debug_macros
   turn_on_warnings
   map_source_code
   generate_database
  check_filename

 cleanup</code></pre>
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>Lots of things to be done here, really. Using something like
SQLite allows me to dump way more metadata than I know what
to do with right now.</p>
<p>For starters, I'd like to parse save org structure in
addition to tangled code structure. I'm hoping to build
more utilities that generate interesting representations of
the document. Hoping to build a better static HTML
generator than the simple one I have currently written. I
also want to build a simple HTTP server that dynamic
generates HTML content. Maybe throw in a few dot graph
generators for good measure?</p>
<p>Being able to write multiple worgle programs into one
database is important to me as well, as this would allow
more incremental (hopefully faster) development to happen.</p>
