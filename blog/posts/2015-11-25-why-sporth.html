<h1>Why Sporth?</h1>
<p>2015-11-25</p>
<p>This week is Thanksgiving break, which means I have some free time to blog, and also
some time to work on some my final projects for school. As it turns out, I've
managed to weasel in my quirky language <a href="/proj/sporth.html">Sporth</a> into <em>all</em> my 
final projects. This means at some point, I will have to explain what Sporth is to people,
and answer this inevitable question: "Why would I ever want to use Sporth?".</p>
<p>I can't directly answer that question, and I don't really want to. What I can do is explain
why I built Sporth in the first place. To understand this, we must look at one of my
all-time favorite music languages: Csound. Consider this an "origin" story.</p>
<p>Csound has a pretty awesome reverb opcode called
<a href="http://csound.github.io/docs/manual/reverbsc.html">reverbsc</a>. I use it in all my ambient
pieces, as it provides a beautiful and large reverb. </p>
<p>Here's one of many ways I'd use ReverbSC in Csound:</p>
<p><pre><code>sr = 44100
ksmps = 1
nchnls = 1
0dbfs = 1</p>
<p>instr 1
<pre><code> ainput diskin2 &quot;piano.wav&quot;, 1
 aoutL, aoutR reverbsc ainput, ainput, 0.97, 10000
 out aoutL</code></pre>
<p>endin
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></p>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="/res/why_sporth/rev.orc">example</a> above, I'm using ReverbSC to process an audio file called "piano.wav".</p>
<p>I loved ReverbSC so much, that I wanted to build a plugin out of it. While the Csound API
could do this task (and things like Cabbage and the like exist for this), I found it to be
too much overhead for the task. I didn't need <em>all</em> of Csound to run ReverbSC, just 
the code for this particular opcode. So I looked into the Csound source code, extracted the
code I needed, and wrote a simple C interface around it. I did this for a few other Opcodes 
I liked, and built <a href="/proj/soundpipe.html">Soundpipe</a>. </p>
<p>With Soundpipe, I was able to port the Csound code above to a page of C <a href="/res/why_sporth/rev.c">code</a>:</p>
<p><pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include "soundpipe.h"</p>
<p>typedef struct {
<pre><code> sp_diskin *disk;
 sp_revsc *rev;</code></pre>
<p>} UserData;</p>
</p>
<p>void process(sp_data <em>sp, void </em>udata) {
<pre><code> UserData *ud= udata;
 SPFLOAT in = 0;
 SPFLOAT out = 0;
 SPFLOAT foo = 0;</code></pre>
</p>
<pre><code> sp_diskin_compute(sp, ud-&amp;gt;disk, NULL, &amp;in);
 sp_revsc_compute(sp, ud-&amp;gt;rev, &amp;in, &amp;in, &amp;sp-&amp;gt;out[0], &amp;foo); </code></pre>
}<p>int main() {
<pre><code> UserData ud;
 sp_data *sp;
 sp_create(&amp;sp);</code></pre>
</p>
<pre><code> sp_diskin_create(&amp;ud.disk);
 sp_revsc_create(&amp;ud.rev);</code></pre>
<pre><code> sp_diskin_init(sp, ud.disk, &quot;piano.wav&quot;);
 sp_revsc_init(sp, ud.rev);
 ud.rev-&amp;gt;feedback = 0.97;
 ud.rev-&amp;gt;lpfreq = 10000;</code></pre>
<pre><code> sp-&amp;gt;len = 44100 * 10;
 sp_process(sp, &amp;ud, process);</code></pre>
<pre><code> sp_diskin_destroy(&amp;ud.disk);
 sp_revsc_destroy(&amp;ud.rev);
 sp_destroy(&amp;sp);
 return 0;</code></pre>
<p>}&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></p>
<p>I now had the means to build a ReverbSC plugin without needing the Csound API. From a programming standpoint,
things were way less complicated now. With minimal dependencies and painless build system, Soundpipe became a 
lightweight alternative to the Csound API. However, it meant I needed to write more code. It took more time
to make tweaks to patches, and hindering my creative productivity. </p>
<p>I soon realized that I needed an abstraction for Soundpipe so I didn't have to worry about the low-level 
details while composing. I decided to build a domain-specific language on top of Soundpipe that could
easily be embedded into larger applications the same way Soundpipe could. I had read up on Forths and
stack based languages how trivial they were to implement, so I went with that. A few weeks later, I built
my Soundpipe Forth and, Sporth was born!</p>
<p>Now my many lines of Soundpipe C code could be written as one line of Sporth <a href="/res/why_sporth/rev.sp">code</a>:</p>
<p><pre><code>"piano.wav" diskin dup 0.97 10000 revsc drop</code></pre>
</p>
<p>And this the essence of why I use Sporth. It is a terse language that allows me to quickly come up with
interesting sounds. And because it is using Csound DNA, things can sound <em>great</em> in the right hands.
I can easily add experimental ugens to the language, and it is easy to embed inside other applications. </p>
<p>I hope someday I won't be the only Sporth user in the world, but for now, I'm plenty happy hacking Sporth 
on my own :)</p>
