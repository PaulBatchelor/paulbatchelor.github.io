<h1>Generative Pixel Art</h1>
<p>2015-08-20</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've written anything. Many projects and things, 
and no time to write them.</p>
<p>I've rewritten my site generator from scratch, hopefully this will allow me to 
write more frequently. For now, this is a bit of a fluff post. A cool fluff post,
but a fluff post.</p>
<p>An idea I've wanted always to toy with is generative pixel art. Today, I whipped 
this up using lua and imagemagick:</p>

</p>
<p>The overall functionality is quite simple. The lua script generates and writes a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format">PPM file</a>
to standard output. The output of the lua script is piped into the imagemagick
CLI, where it is scaled 400% and written to a PNG file.</p>
