<h1>libline: a library for lines in music</h1>
<p>2017-08-27</p>
<p>This past week I have been putting time into implementing a library whose 
primary responsibilty is in generating lines. I have given it the extremely
creative name <a href="/proj/libline">libline</a>. </p>
<h2>The need for lines</h2>
<p>Lines are an important abstraction in the sonic domain. They can be used to 
describe musical gestures and changes over time. </p>
<p>When composing with <a href="/proj/sporth.html">Sporth</a>, I have often found myself 
desiring lines to transform sounds over time. For a period of time, I 
considered using automation curves via <a href="2017-02-25-LMMS-sporth.html">LMMS</a>, 
but I quickly found it to be 
<a href="2017-03-18-lmms-part2.html">clunky and not great</a>
for more than a few lines at a time. </p>
<p>My efforts with LMMS were not in vain, because it gave me a taste
of lines in Sporth. Mapping a line (or lines)
over an extended duration to a Sporth patch has the the potential of 
strengthening an underlying musical form such as a beginning, middle, and end. 
My <a href="/sporthlings">Sporthlings</a> up to this point have no such concepts, so this 
would be an interesting change.</p>
<h2>Literate Programming</h2>
<p>Like my last project, <a href="/proj/voc">Voc</a>, libline is written using the literate
documentation system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWEB">CWEB</a>.
However, unlike that project, I have made the choice
to include the generated C and header files with the repository, so that
the library can be compiled on systems without CWEB installed.
While it does
add to the overhead in github, the size and scope of the project makes the
issue negligible. </p>
<p>Literate programming is quite an addictive thing to do. It is simple enough to
write code for a program, but there are so many wrong ways to explain why 
the code is there in the first place. It has challenged me to think about the
presentation of code, and trying to make the experience of reading code be
more than a nervous line-by-line skimming. </p>
<h2>Functionality in Sporth</h2>
<p>I have decided to provide an early (and rash) introduction of libline into 
Sporth via the scheme interface provided by <a href="/proj/polysporth">polysporth</a>,
a utility inside of Sporth designed to do things beyond the Sporth language
abstraction. </p>
<p>The following example shows how to control a sine wave oscillator
using line segments generated via libline.</p>
<p>The program has two file: a polysporth interface files written using an
internal dialect of scheme, and a sporth file.</p>
<p>The scheme file contains all code related to polysporth. It is here that
the lines are constructed. Sporth syntax alone doesn't really have a concept of 
initialization code (only as a runtime mode in a ugen). With scheme, this
concept exists.</p>
<p>Lines created in libline are audio-rate signals that are bound to Sporth
variables:</p>
<pre><code> ; Create a new line stored in variable &quot;freq&quot;
 (ps-line-begin &quot;freq&quot;)
 ; linearly go from 440 to 880 in one second
 (ps-line-linpoint 440 1.0)
 (ps-line-step 880 1.0)
 ; next, exponentially go from 440 to 880 in one second with a slope of 10
 (ps-line-exppoint 440 1.0 10)
 (ps-line-step 880 1.0)
  
 ; end the line
 (ps-line-end)
  
 ; Create a gate signal so that the line shuts off after 4 seconds
 (ps-line-begin &quot;gate&quot;)
 (ps-line-step 1 4)
 (ps-line-step 0 1)
 (ps-line-end)
  
 ; Export variables so they show up in the upper level sporth patch
 (ps-export &quot;freq&quot; &quot;freq&quot;)
 (ps-export &quot;gate&quot; &quot;gate&quot;)
  
 ; &quot;ll&quot; is the unit generator that is called exactly once to generate
 ; line segments. Export this to the upper level sporth patch as well
 (ps-export &quot;ll&quot; &quot;ll&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The Sporth code is in charge of loading the polysporth scheme code and
producing the sinusoidal sounds. It also bears the responsibility of making
sure the lines generated are being computed: </p>
<pre><code> # Load the file test.scm and create a polysporth handle. 
 # No (0) voices needed.
 _ps 0 &quot;test.scm&quot; psh
 
 # Needed to be called exactly once. It will compute the line segments
 _ll fe
 
 # Map the frequency line to the frequency of a sine wave
 _freq get 0.5 sine
 
 # multiply it all by the gate signal
 _gate get *</code></pre>
<p>This patch is run from the Sporth file. Save the Sporth code as "test.sp" and
the polysporth code as "test.scm". Then run: </p>
<pre><code> sporth test.sp</code></pre>
<p>To generate a 5-second audio file with the sounds!</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>This work is ongoing and quite new, so expect everything to be subject of 
change. As has been with my projects, the trajectory will be determined by how
I end up using this to make music. At the moment, my interests lie in 
generating automation curves and triggerable gestures. Some sort of 
higher-level construction of lines may also be in the equation. We will see...</p>
