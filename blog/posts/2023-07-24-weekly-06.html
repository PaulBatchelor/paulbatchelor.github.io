<h1>Weekly Update 6: Symbols, Sounds, and Mantras</h1>
<p>2023-07-24</p>
<p>This past week, I found myself thinking about symbols,
sounds, and Mantras.
<h2>Mantra</h2>
<p>To begin, a small compositional sketch with some graphics
to accompany it:</p>
</p>

</p>
<p>I call this a Mantra because the sound is a looping pattern.
The pattern is less obvious because the tempo of the pattern
keeps changing. This is a trick I sometimes use to add
more variation where there is none.</p>
<p>The visuals act as a kind of "score" for the sound. It
depicts 6 symbols, where each symbol corresponds to a
phoneme in the sound. The performance plays two phonemes,
then slides between them. If the symbols were represented
as ABCDEF, then the performance could be notated as
AB A~B CD C~D EF E~F.</p>
<p>This may not sound like much, but it represents
a culminiation of the work I've been doing over
the past few weeks.</p>
<h2>Sounds</h2>
<p>The vocal-like sounds heard above use the new computer
simulation of the <a href="/blog/posts/2023-07-02-weekly-03.html">vocal tract I've been developing</a>
(more frequently known as a "physical model" of the
vocal tract). One of the new things I can do with this
tract is adjust its length: a longer tract yields a voice
that sounds like it is coming from a bigger thing. As a
result, this is a voice that is both large and deep in
pitch.</p>
<p>This voice sounds a bit like Throat Singing, and in many
ways the approach is very similar to that vocal technique.
Throat Singing puts a large amount of focus in the shaping
of the vocal tract to produce timbre. The Voice here also
puts a great deal of attention into change the shape
of its virtual vocal tract. In fact, that is the only thing
being changed here. The pitch remains constant, and
it doesn't ever pause or turn off. By changing the vocal
tract shape, different vowel sounds emerge.</p>
<p>Dynamic vocal tract shaping is done by taking a set of
premade shapes, and then smoothly blending between them
in time. The timing characteristics of the blending are
determined using <a href="/wiki/gesture">Gesture Synthesis</a>, which
is a very important topic, but not one for this Blog post.</p>
<p>Vocal tract shapes are "sculpted" interactively using
a tool I built, which was the focus of what I worked on
<a href="/blog/posts/2023-07-17-weekly-05.html">last week</a>. This
week, I added the ability to load and save shapes. Using
this tool, I was able to make 6 distinct tract shapes, which
are used in the Mantra above.</p>

<h2>Symbols</h2>
<p>The ability to load and save shapes with the interactive
tract sculpter comes with some new design issues to
solve. First, what do you call any given shape? Some of
these shapes sound like familiar vowels like "ah", and
"oh", but many more are a bit more in between sounds.
Secondly, once you come up with a name, how do you
effectively display it on the <a href="/wiki/monome_grid">grid</a>?
The Grid has low information density. Even drawing a single
letter on the grid could take up almost half of the screen
space.</p>
<p>One possible way to address the first problem is to
simply automate the naming process. Since trying to
properly label these sounds is mostly an arbtirary
association, just have a computer program write one up.
This saves quite a bit of work, because now there doesn't
need to be a system to input in a label.</p>
<p>To solve the second issue, I built <a href="/gestlings/klover">klover</a>,
an algorithmic way to produce aesthetically pleasing
symbols that also fit well on the grid. By condensing
a shape's name down to a symbol, one maximizes the amount
of information that can be displayed on the Grid at once.</p>

<p>This work is directly inspired by Square Kufic Calligraphy,
which I've explored in previous projects such
as <a href="/wiki/kuf">Kuf</a> and <a href="/wiki/trikuf">Trikuf</a>.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>I'm putting sound aside for a few weeks yet again. I will
be focusing on things related to story and narrative, as
well as some map design.</p>
<p>That's all I got to say for now.</p>
