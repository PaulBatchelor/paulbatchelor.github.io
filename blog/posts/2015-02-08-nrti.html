<h1>9 Ways to NRT, part 7: Creating an interactive NRT parser</h1>
<p>2015-02-08</p>
<p>Welcome to Part 7 of 9 Ways to NRT!</p>
<p>NRT by itself does not have a built-in interactive mode, and it doesn't need 
one. It is simple enough to implement
an interactive environment built the Unix way. I call it NRTi.</p>
<p>NRTi can be found in the part 7 folder on the nineways github.</p>
<h4>Running</h4>
<p>To run NRTi, you must have NRT (duh), Csound, and rlwrap installed.</p>
<p>NRTi has two components: the "sender" and the "reciever". To start the 
reciever, run this command:</p>
<p><pre><code>sh nrti-reciever.sh | csound simple.csd</code></pre>
</p>
<p>In the csound file, you will most likely have to change some of the CsOptions 
and samplerate to match
your computers setup (unless you happen to be running on Linux with Jack 
running at a samplerate of 96kHz.) </p>
<p>The reciever should now be waiting patiently for input from the sender.</p>
<p>To start the sender,  run this command:
<pre><code>rlwrap sh nrti-sender.sh</code></pre> </p>
<p>A command prompt should now appear. Type some nrt (like "drmfs") and hear 
Csound play it back.</p>
<h4>How it Works</h4>
<p>NRTi uses a named pipe (literally named pipe in this instance) to send and 
recieve information. When the reciever is started, it creates a pipe using the 
<em>mkfifo</em> command. Information from that pipe is then piped to NRT. NRT output is
converted to a Csound score in an awk script. These score events are then sent 
to Csound, set to read standard 
input from the <em>-Lstdin</em> flag, which play the simple FM instrument that I 
designed.</p>
<p>The simplest way to send stuff to the reciever is to echo to the named pipe (ie 
echo 'drmfs' > pipe). The sender is an interface for this command. Running the 
sender command will work, but it doesn't behave the way a shell would (You 
cannot backspace, for instance.) The program rlwrap acts as a libreadline 
wrapper for our application, easily providing these niceties.</p>
