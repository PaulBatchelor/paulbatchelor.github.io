<h1>Sporth and Pure Data. Pure Data and Sporth.</h1>
<p>2017-07-01</p>
<p>Today I thought I'd talk a little bit about my efforts in getting 
my audio language <a href="/proj/sporth">Sporth</a> and <a href="http://puredata.info">Pure Data</a> 
to work together. This post will describes my pd external for 
Sporth, as well as my more recent efforts in getting PD patches to run
inside of Sporth.</p>
<h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
<p>For those who don't know, PD is a visual programming language by Miller Puckette. 
Programs are made by connecting blocks together. PD is a very popular free 
alternative to the commercial software Max/MSP (which Miller also created while
at IRCAM.) It is an environment intended for composers and multimedia artists. 
Pure Data has two concurrent versions that are developed: "vanilla" and "extended".
The vanilla version is developed by Miller Puckette himself, and the extended
version is a fork built on top of PD vanilla with a reworked GUI and a bunch 
of nice built-in extensions and plugins. The focus of this blog post will be 
on vanilla pd, and <em>not</em> pd-extended.</p>
<p>Traditionally, I've never really understood the hype about visual programming 
interfaces. 
They are very mouse-driven interfaces, and I find the mouse to be a very clumsy
means of interacting with computers (the touch screens found on phones and tablets, 
on the other hand, are very intriguing to me). Compared to text-based languages,
PD and Max were always slow for me to work in. The patch cable paradigm, while
cute for small and simple patches, always turned into a nightmare for more
complicated patches. </p>
<p>More recently, things like Apple Playgrounds and some of the work by 
<a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Bret Victor</a>
have made me warm a little bit to the idea of introducing visual elements into
traditional text-based means of programming. For creative sound design, it is
very nice to have UI elements and visualizers for feeling out the behavior
of particular synth patch. Visual elements also provide a really nice means
of organizing information. Even something like 
<a href="/proj/voc">rich formatted text in literate programming</a> can really be a huge
step from from just plain code. </p>
<h2>Sporth inside of PD</h2>
<p>About a year ago, I made it possible to run Sporth patches inside of PD as
a PD external. This project is part of the Sporth code distribution, located
in <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/Sporth/tree/master/util/pd">/util/pd/</a>. 
My initial motivation for making this was for demo purposes; knobs and sliders
are far more engaging than just sporth code by itself.</p>
<p>The Sporth PD external could do things like compile/recompile Sporth files and
read/write to <a href="/proj/cook/pregisters.html">p-registers</a>. The Sporth API made it 
trivial to spawn multiple instances of Sporth in a single patch (take <em>that</em> 
ChucK and PD!). </p>
<p>A few days ago, I made it possible get the external to compile strings from
inside the patch, rather than from an external text file. This made a few things
easy. Firstly, removing the need for external files made it much easier to
distribute. Secondly, multiple instances of Sporth could be used together
in a very easy way:</p>
<p><img src="/res/blog/pdsporth/pd.png" alt="multiple sporth instances" />.</p>
<p>Instead of having to recompile the entire Sporth patch, individual segments
could be chunked and recompiled separately as needed. </p>
<h2>PD inside of Sporth</h2>
<p>I've been recently interesting in leveraging PD in my work. While I do quite 
enjoy working in Sporth environment, I will concede that there are some 
performance limitations to Sporth's naively created structure. PD, on the other 
hand, was created by someone much smarter myself, and I believe the audio graph
used for signal processing to be better than the linked-list stack-based 
system Sporth uses. </p>
<p>These motivations have lead me to make <a href="
https://github.com/paulbatchelor/sporth-pd">sporth-pd</a>, a Sporth plugin that compiles
a PD patch (read-only) and computes the audio from it from inside of Sporth.
This plugin is limited to only PD instance per Sporth patch. One has the ability
to load patches that contain PD externals. Because of this, it is indeed
possible to load Sporth from PD, from inside of Sporth. This feature has also
motivated to me to begin building my own 
<a href="
https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/pdsp">PD externals using Soundpipe directly.</a></p>
<p>A popular way to embed PD inside of applications is through 
<a href="http://libpd.cc">libpd</a>. For my needs, I found libpd distribution to be far
too bloated for my needs. Using the <a href="
https://github.com/libpd/libpd/blob/master/libpd_wrapper/z_libpd.c">libpdwrapper code</a> as 
a reference, I used the PD api directly to build my Sporth plugin. I also 
decided to include PD as a submodule in the project, so I could compile
a minimal local version of PD. I have tried to reduce the dependencies as much
as I can, but I have unable to get rid of the portaudio depdendency, even
with the dummy audio flags (UPDATE: since writing this blog post, 
the portaudio dependency has been removed. Yay!). </p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>As I learn more about how to actually use PD, I hope to better solidify the
relationship between itself and Sporth. I also want to someday be able to 
somehow get <a href="/proj/spigot">Spigot</a> and PD talking to one another, and perhaps
get Spigot running inside of PD somehow.</p>
