<h3># 9 ways to NRT, part 2: NRT and Csound</h3>
<p>2014-12-20</p>
<p>Welcome to Part 2 of <a href="{% post_url 2014-12-19-nrt-syntax %}">9 Ways to NRT</a></p>
<p>Today, I'm going to show how <a href="http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/nrt">NRT</a>
can be used to play a synthesizer in Csound.</p>
<p>Recently, I discovered that the '-Lstdin' flag lets Csound read from standard input.
This means that NRT can pipe stuff to Csound without ever needing to write anything to file. </p>
<p>NRT can't do this directly; it needs an intermediate filter to convert NRT output to a
Csound score. Luckilly, this couldn't be easier with a little help from our old pal Awk.</p>
<h4>Introducing Awk</h4>
<p>Awk is a scripting language designed to extract data from text files, one line 
at a time. From there, Awk can do stuff to those values. Awk can either read 
from a text file or from stuff piped from standard input; we will use the 
latter to directly send NRT's output to Awk.</p>
<p>NRT output is designed to be fed to Awk, so it is a good practice to use Awk 
as an encoder before piping NRT data to external programs.</p>
<h4>Creating a Csound Score with Awk</h4>
<p>Here is an example of NRT creating a Csound score with Awk:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo "drm" | nrt | awk -F',' '{print "i1",$1,$2,$3 + 60}'

i1 0 1 60
i1 1 1 62
i1 2 1 64
</code>
</pre>

We are piping NRT notation into <em>nrt</em> using <em>echo</em>. Then we are piping the 
output of <em>nrt</em> into the input of awk. Awk then prints the formatted Csound 
score, adding 60 (C4 in midi) to the note number, which puts everything in 
the key of C.<p>This is a valid Csound score, but this program will only write melodies at 60bpm in
the key of C. We can modify our program to have variable tempo and key (note offset).
The program is still technically a "one-liner", but it has been broken up into 2
lines:</p>
<pre><code>
$ echo "drm" | nrt | awk -F',' -vTEMPO=120 -vBASE=60 \
    'BEGIN{ts=60/TEMPO} {print "i1",$1*ts,$2*ts,$3 + BASE}'

i1 0 0.5 60
i1 0.5 0.5 62
i1 1 0.5 64
</code></pre>
<h3>The Csound Orchestra </h3>
<p>To match the generate score, the Csound orchestra needs an instrument with an 
ID of "1" that reads in a midi note number (the 4th p-field). </p>
<p>The instrument below in a simple karplus-strong instrument being sent to a
reverb. You can copy and paste this into a file called "pluckrev.csd" or you can
download the file <a href="/res/nineways/pluckrev.csd">here</a>.</p>
<p>File <em>pluckrev.csd</em>:</p>

endin
&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Piping it all together</h3>
<p>Everything can now be piped together in a single bash command. I've changed the
melody here to make it more interesting:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo "drm2tsd" | nrt | awk -F',' -vTEMPO=120 -vBASE=60 \
    'BEGIN{ts=60/TEMPO} {print "i1",$1*ts,$2*ts,$3 + BASE} ' |\
    Csound -Lstdin -odac pluckrev.csd
</code></pre>

The output of Awk is being piped into the input of Csound. Depending on your 
operating system and driver setup, your Csound command line flags may vary. 
For instance, this is what I had to put in to get to get Csound to run on my 
Linux machine running Jack:<pre><code>$ echo "drm2tsd" | nrt | awk -F',' -vTEMPO=120 -vBASE=60 \
    'BEGIN{ts=60/TEMPO} {print "i1",$1*ts,$2*ts,$3 + BASE} ' |\
    Csound -Lstdin -odac:system:playback_ -+rtaudio="jack" -b 2048 pluckrev.csd
</code></pre>
