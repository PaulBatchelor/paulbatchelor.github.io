<h3># 9 ways to NRT, part 5: Generating Milkytracker files with NRT</h3>
<p>2015-01-02</p>
<p>Welcome to Part 5 of 9 Ways to NRT</p>
<p>Today, NRT will be used to generate XM files, which are the native file format
for the fasttracker 2 inspired music tracker Milkytracker. </p>
<p>The main program used in generating the XM files is 
<a href="/portfolio/xmt_page.html">libXMT</a>, a Lua library I wrote a few months ago. Using XMT,
I wrote a lua script that could parse the output of NRT and write the note information to 
an XM file.<br />  </p>
<p>The cool thing about the XM file format is that it is a self-contained piece
of music with a very small footprint.  XM can embed samples and wavetable 
synthesizers inside of itself. Conceptually, it is a lot like a MIDI file with sounds. 
The script I made programatically creates a squarewave synthesizer that plays
the NRT notes. </p>
<p>Using the <code>nrt2xm</code> program, one could use it with NRT in the following
way with this bash script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
nrt_string="d4. r8 m s | t4 s m | r2 t4 | (D2. m s)"
BPM=120
offset=70
echo $nrt_string | nrt -F' ' | sort -n | ./nrt2xm out.xm $BPM $offset
</code></pre>

The NRT program uses the '-F' flag to change the separator from the default comma 
to a space. This is done so the notes can be sorted chronologically with the Unix 
command <code>sort</code> before being fed into the lua script <code>nrt2xm</code>

Running this script generates a file called "out.xm", opening it up in Milkytracker
gives you a pattern that looks like this:<img src="/res/nineways/milkyshot.png">
<p>All code can be found on the 9 ways to NRT 
<a href="http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/NineWaysToNRT">github</a></p>
<p>The nrt2xm program, while absolutely functional for basic NRT notation, is definitely 
proof-of-concept and should be modified for any serious needs. </p>
