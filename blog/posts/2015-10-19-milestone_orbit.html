<h1>Project Orbit: Design Proposal</h1>
<p>2015-10-19</p>
<p>Today is the due date for my project proposal for a computer music design class
that I am currently enrolled in.</p>
<p>The intended software to be designed (codename Project Orbit) will be an isorhythmic
sequencer. It will use OpenGL for graphics, and RtAudio, Sporth, and Soundpipe for
its audio engine. </p>
<p>You can see some of the concept sketches here:</p>

<p>I took this as an opportunity to write up a semi-formal design proposal, where
I analyze existing applications that have similar design aesthetics. I wanted to 
see how well I could articulate my design preferences. The pdf can be
found <a href="/res/project_orbit/article.pdf">here</a> and the LaTeX file can be found 
<a href="/res/project_orbit/article.tex">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first time Sporth will be used an embedded synthesis language, and 
a notable example of Soundpipe being used inside an application. I've written some
of the code, and it works surprisingly well. I have decided not to release the 
source code until I have turned in the assignment, but I will certainly post screenshots, 
soundbytes, and screenshots as often as possible!</p>
