<h1>Weekly Update 4: A Text Editor for the Monome Grid</h1>
<p>2023-07-10
<h1>A Text Editor on the Grid</h1>
</p>
<p>This week, I found myself building a hyper-minimal
"text editor" for
the <a href="/wiki/monome_grid">monome grid</a> (previously known
as just the "monome" before they started making other
hardware). The grid is a 16-by-8 array of silicone buttons
that have LED lights that can be indepedently controlled.</p>
<p>One could say I have chosen to build a text editor for
the one of the world's largest smallest touch screens.</p>
<p>Here's a video of me interacting with it. Notice how I
use a large knob to scroll through a set of symbols:</p>
<p><video controls>

</p>
<p>With some updates, I added some navigation. Now, there's
a mix of a mechanical keypad, the knob, and the grid itself
to jump around the symbols:</p>

</p>
<p>Here I am now inserting and removing symbols via the
mechanical keypad using the <a href="/wiki/ortho33">ortho33</a> input
method I
designed a last week. You'll note that the bottom righthand
portion of the Grid is a 3x3 status "box" that shows the
state of the keypad as well as if I'm in edit or navigation
mode:</p>

</p>
<p>Finally, I added multi-line support, which as this
point almost makes it a "text editor". Except, instead of
"text", they are symbols.</p>

<h1>Where's the Sound?: an attempt to explain myself</h1>
<p>Before you ask, there is no sound. Not yet at least. The
idea is to have this be a core tool for the <a href="/wiki/gestlings">gestlings</a>
project. But not <a href="/wiki/toys_not_tools">too much of a tool</a>, since
I have <a href="/gestlings/TODO">to do a lot of things</a> and I have
given my self a <a href="/gestlings/progress">time budget</a> to finish
the project.</p>
<p>The thing is, there's just a lot to build before actual
sound can occur. <a href="/gestlings">Gestlings</a>, a spirtual descendent of
<a href="/sporthlings">Sporthings</a>, can be thought of as a collection
studies in <a href="/wiki/gesture">Gestures Synthesis</a>, a novel
technique I've been developing for controlling sound in
a procedurally generated way. This by itself is too vague
and too stiff and too boring. There needs to be more to it.
Gesture synthesis is connected to human singing, the voice
apparatus, and lyrical performances in music. So, since
it's the voice and everything, let's have each "Gestling"
introduce themselves. That's much more interesting than
"computer music sound studies". Voices imply character,
which imply personality. Also, voices don't come from
nowhere, they usually come from a mouth, and mouths
are attached to faces. And faces are usually attached to
a body, and bodies are in an environment. What are these
Gestlings saying? Why are they saying it?
<a href="/wiki/howyousay">How Are They Saying It?</a> What is their
motivation? And so on, and so forth.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Gestlings are more than mere "etudes" or
"compositional studies". Now they are "Sounds With Faces",
and hopefully they have something to say. I am in over my head.</p>
<p>So, Gestlings are going to be these creatures that have
something to say, and I'm going to be the one programming
what it is they say. How to do that? Develop a constructed
language, or "conlang", write something to say in
that language, and make a speech synthesizer
that can perform those words. Realize that I'm a composer and
not a linguist.
I am also lazy and on a (time) budget, so a lot of shortcuts
are taken. Firstly, I don't need formal language, just
a blurry shadow of one. It's the tone color of speech
that fascinates me, not really the semantics of language.
Really the prosody is all I care about,
in my <a href="/gestlings/protogestling">initial gestling prototype</a>
has subtitles and is speaking gibberish. Puppycat does it.
R2D2 does it. Charlie Brown's Teacher does it.
I think it works out quite well for them.</p>
<p>Even if you build a "language" that isn't actually a language
and total <a href="/codex">gibberish</a> or "asemic speech", there's
still going to be <em>some</em> structure that remains. I've decided to try
thinking of this structure as a set of symbols. This editor,
which I intend to call "bitrune", aims to be an editor for
these symbols.</p>
<p>I've built out a very constrained system for myself. It
may end up being too constained, but I'm going to try to
stick to it. The design challenge will be building up symbol
sets that allow one to be creatively expressive with these
constraints.</p>
