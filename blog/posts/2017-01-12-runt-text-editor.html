<h1>Hacking text editors for Runt</h1>
<p>2017-01-12</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, I've been hacking text editors (plural) to work with 
<a href="/proj/runt">Runt</a>, my little stack-based interpreter. </p>
<h2>Motivations </h2>
<p>Mainly live/interactive coding. I've had great joy and success using Sporth 
to build <a href="/sporthlings">compositions</a> using my 
<a href="/blog/posts/2016-08-01-sporth_live_coding.md">live coding setup with Vim</a>. 
Runt in many ways is much better suited for interactive coding, so I figured
I should make something better than irunt for stuff like that. </p>
<p>I made the choice to hack on existing small text editors instead of building
a vim plugin for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small text editors are awesome</li>
<li>I don't know how to make vim plugins</li>
<li>It would be faster to hack a smaller text editor than make a vim plugin</li>
<li>Small text editors can be more "integrated" with Runt vs Vim</li>
<li>Portabiliy and smaller footprint</li>
</ul>
<h2>Kilo</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/kilo">kilo</a> was originally a simple text 
editor in less than 1000 lines of code, made by the wonderful antirez. It has
a feel that reminds me of the nano text editor. By adding a few lines of
code, I modified the program so that hitting CTRL-e would evaluate a line
of Runt code. </p>
<p>I said this was a REPL, and part of a REPL is the print aspect. My solution 
to this was to write all Runt output to a file called "tape". This file could
be monitored in another terminal window using "tail -f tape". Tada! 
Instant REPL.</p>
<h2>leveraging tmux</h2>
<p>Using Kilo and tail were well and good for most things, but I realize that
if multiple sources were writing to the tape file, tail would sometimes not
update. This became a problem when implementing 
<a href="htts://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/runt-plumber">runt-plumber</a> because I 
needed to instantaneously see error messages from Sporth as well as Runt. </p>
<p>As it turns out, tmux has the ability to send text to other terminal windows 
it has spawned. This functionality can be used to replace "tail". Before 
starting Kilo, I ran "ln -s $(tty) tape" in the terminal window where I wanted
to see text output. Then, running kilo in another window, I was able to send
text to the terminal window instead of to a file. This seemed to solve the 
issues I was having.</p>
<h2>Bonus: Sandy</h2>
<p>While Kilo proves to be a highly portable lightweight text editor for Runt, 
I missed my HJKL vi movements, so I looked into hacking another small text 
editor. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/sandy-runt">Sandy</a>
is a vi-like text editor I found many 
years ago.  For a while, I was quite enchanted with it's simplicity and DWM-style 
configuration. It's almost a text editor I'd leave Vim for. (Almost.)
After porting Runt to Kilo, Sandy was a natural option 2. Like
Kilo, CTRL-E evaluates a line and outputs any results to a file called "tape". </p>
