<h1>LMMS and Sporth: part 2</h1>
<p>2017-03-18</p>
<h2>Goodbye, LMMS</h2>
<p>I began writing an outline of this post last week. I had very exciting 
(and perhaps naive) ambitions for what LMMS was going to be in my life. 
And I <em>do</em> have some some interesting I built that I want to talk about. </p>
<p>But if I'm going to be honest, I'm done contributing things to LMMS. I really
don't have the stomach for dealing with some of it's users, who are rude
and hostile towards any of the contributions I have to make. And I just don't
have time for it.</p>
<p>Let me list the things I got chewed up on:
<ul>
<li>changing specific files to MIT license for easier plugin development</li>
<li>Correcting a 10-year old bug which accidently was changed to have negative
vaules instead of all positive ones</li>
<li>Fixing the command-line renderer so it doesn't glitch randomly</li>
<li>Suggesting the removal of worker threads for audio processing</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Look, LMMS hasn't had a real audio developer in a very long time. 
Maybe never, from the looks of it. There are a lot of foul things I found in the source code
Minus the licensing, these are all show
audio stoppers as far as I'm concerned. If my audio software had any of 
those errors,
I would be ashamed to put my name on it. </p>
<p>I'm not a person who simply points 
and laughs at others misfortune. I saw problems in LMMS and did something to
fix them. I've been pretty shocked with the hostile reactions. I just don't
have the stomach, or the time, for contributing to such a place. </p>
<p>This is good bye, LMMS. Oh well.</p>
<p>But first! LMMS.</p>
<h2>Signal</h2>
<p>In my previous post, I was able to write a Sporth editor that could run
as a native LMMS plugin. However, this was implemented as an effect processor, and
could take advantage of the "note" aspects of LMMS. So, I built an instrument
that could be a signal generator for Sporth called <em>Signal</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/lmms-signal">Signal</a> is a monophonic
synthesizer designed to be directly fed into the Sporth editor. It turns
the stereo signal into two control signals: the <em>left</em> signal provides
a MIDI note number, and the <em>right</em> channel provides the gate signal. When
read in by Sporth, they can be used together to build legato instruments. </p>
<p>Building an instrument came with some nice perks. For one thing, instruments
can have their own effects. I can bundle a Sporth with a Signal, and call
it a unit. Much more manageable than using the FX routers. Also presets. You can
save blocks of Sporth code as presets. Total modularity! The final kicker:
the preview preset feature in LMMS also works on Signal presets, so you could
preview Sporth patches! Pretty cool stuff.</p>
<h2>Polysporth and LMMS</h2>
<p>Going through the motions and building these small demos sparked quite a few 
internal dialogues. Firstly, legato instrument design: what an underappreciated 
thing in the keyboard-infested electronic music world. 
Another was a motivation to build legato instruments using 
PolySporth. The idea was I could not only write instruments for LMMS, but
for other Sporthy projects. Using Polysporth, I could easily substitute chunks
of code and create the same instruments for multiple platforms. </p>
<h2>sporth2xpf</h2>
<p>The final thing I did was create a small perl script which took sporth code
and built an LMMS Signal preset out of it, called <em>sporth2xpf</em>. It should be
available in the Signal repostiory. Pretty nice of LMMS folks to have plaintext 
file for their instrument format. Makes things ripe for happy hacking.</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>There are no future plans to support LMMS. Not until I build my own tools that
do the things I wanted LMMS to do. And what those things are, well, that's
for another time.</p>
