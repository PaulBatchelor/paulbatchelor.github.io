<h1>Contrenot Assembly</h1>
<p>2016-11-30</p>
<p>As mentioned in my previous posts, I am in the middle of a quarter-long project
to build an interface inspired by an upright bass. Here is an update. This really
should have been two posts, but I've been working, so here's just one post.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, the Contrenot is basically assembled. It makes sound,
and is in reasonably good shape. As a bass player, I find it to be a familiar interface. 
Bystanders (non-bass players) that tried to play the instrument had a harder time 
playing with the instrument. To me, this is a big success: I wanted my
years of experience playing classical bass to translate to electronic
sound.</p>
<p>The name "Contrenot" comes from the name "contrebass" and "martenot",
the pull-string electronic instrument where I have drawn the most inspiration
(the creation of which was inspired by the cello). Contrary to what the
name suggests, the Contrenot does not (and will not) sound like a 
bass. Instead, I plan to produce a more soloistic sound in a higher register. </p>
<p>Many many hours were put in to get to this point. I will pick up 
where I left off.</p>
<h2>Buying Supplies</h2>
<p><a href="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/large/homedepot2.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/small/homedepot2.jpg" alt="Home depot trip

<p>After building a bow prototype the week before, it was time to buy 
lumber for the body. This meant a trip to the local home depot.</p>
<p>At the store, I spent a lot of time laying wood out on the floor
and measuring it to get the right width. The picture above shows one
of the layouts I did, which included the approximate placement of the
bow and endpin. Unfortunately, I did not end up going with those 
oak sides... they were a bit too expensive for this prototype.</p>
<h2>Initial body assembly </h2>
<p><a href="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/large/firstlayout.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/small/firstlayout.jpg" alt="First layout
" /></a></p>
<p>After purchasing the wood, I immediately went to work assembling body. 
The 2x4 planks were cut to size to build a neck and an endblock for the
endpin. The hole I made for the endpin was not straight, which is why 
it is crooked in the picture (rough prototype yay). </p>
<p>The picture above show the instrument a little bit in the future, with the arduino,
perfboard, and components mounted.</p>
<h2>Electronics</h2>
<p><a href="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/large/breadboard.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/small/breadboard.jpg" alt="Breadboarding components
" /></a></p>
<p>With the body constructed, it was time to focus on the electronics. 
First, all the sensors were tested individually with the breadboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>linear softpot</strong> was fairly easy to hook up to an analogue pin 
for reading.</li>
<li>The <strong>linear FSR</strong> was a little bit more finnicky for me to get set up.
The pins on these are not the greatest.</li>
<li>The <strong>16-bit adc</strong> from Adafruit was mostly easy set up thanks to the
tutorials available. Getting the linear softpot hooked up took some 
experimentation with resistor size to get the maximum resolution. I ended
up getting approximate 20,000 steps. Compare that to the wimpy 1024 steps
you get with the 10-bit ADC on arduino.</li>
<li>The <strong>rotary encoder</strong> was a later addition to testing. I purchased the 
200 p/r encoder from sparkfun. Lots of ups and downs with this component. 
More on this later..</li>
</ul>

" /></a></p>
<p>After all the components were tested, I began transfering the breadboarded
circuits to a perfboard. Breadboard layouts
can be kind of misleading, and dont transfer exactly to the perf board. 
It took me three tries to figure that out (as a side effect,
I got a lot better at soldering!)</p>
<p><a href="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/large/perfboard2.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/small/perfboard2.jpg" alt="Perfboard, mostly final
" /></a></p>
<p>After multiple attempts, I was finally able to get a perfboard working. 
It is displayed above. In retrospect, I do regret using single wire instead
of stranded wire. A learning experience indeed.</p>

<p>Speaking of wires, the picture above shows the perfboard and arduino wired 
and mounted on the body. A mess (did I mention this was my first real
hardware project?), but it works!</p>
<h2>Fitting the new encoder</h2>
<p><a href="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/large/rotaryencoder.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/small/rotaryencoder.jpg" alt="Fitting the new encoder
" /></a></p>
<p>Since progress was faster than planned, I decided to try replacing
my griffin knob with a rotary encoder for better resolution (and to have
one USB cable).  I ended up buying a 200 P/R rotary encoder off 
sparkfun, designed mainly for use in robotics. It is displayed above 
being fitted with a custom 3d printed knob I designed for it. </p>
<p>Man. This rotary encoder was almost more trouble than it was worth.
For starters, I realized after purchasing it that it could not 
detect direction, only distance. This turned out to be more than fine
for me: I did not need direction, and it ended up being much more 
simple component to work with. </p>
<p>There were also several points where I thought I had broken the encoder.
I was so convinced of this that I went ahead and bought another encoder with
rush delivery.  It turns out that I did not break the encoder. 
It was just a really hard to find bug in my code that made it look broken. 
Oh well.</p>
<p>The encoder was a big improvement over the griffin knob, and had much 
more resolution. So much resolution, that the arduino was not fast enough
to read it! I ended up having to hook the encoder up to a hardware
interrupt. After I did that, I found that serial was also way too slow
to do anything related to velocity. I went back and wrote more code that 
utilized the onboard timers to very precisely measure the distance between 
pulses in the encoder, and sent <em>those</em> measurements over serial. With
lots of smoothing and math, I was able to implement some very satisfying
smoothing.</p>
<p><a href="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/large/encoder_layout.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/small/encoder_layout.jpg" alt="New encoder, old layout
" /></a></p>
<p>After thinking I had broken the encoder, I went back and rethought
how to fit the new encoder into the body. The old way above required 
sending the cord through a hole. I felt this design put too much
strain on the cord, which caused it to "break". As a result, I ended
up designing a much better system. </p>
<p><a href="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/large/encodernew.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/small/encodernew.jpg" alt="New encoder, new layout
" /></a></p>
<p>The picture above shows the new layout. The encoder and spool were flipped
90 degrees, and dowel rods were added to hold the encoder in place. Less 
stress was placed on the cord, and winding the spring ended up being
much easier to do. Adjustments could be more nuanced, so the pull
was a lot smoother as well.</p>
<h2>Softpot callibration</h2>
<p><a href="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/large/calibrate.jpg"><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_assembly/small/calibrate.jpg" alt="Calibrating the neck
" /></a></p>
<p>With all the components working, it was time to get some test
sounds created, starting with the softpot. To my disappointment,
I found that while I had many bits of resoltion in the softpot, 
those bits were not evenly distributed. 90% of the bits were clumped
in 25% of the space in the top. This lead to a few attempts to 
remap the signal to make it more linear.</p>
<p>My first thought was that the distribution logarhithmic, so I fit
an exponential equation to some data points that I measured. The
plots I made highly suggested a log curve, and the math I threw at
it to make it linear seemed to help:</p>
