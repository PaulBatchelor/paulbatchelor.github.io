<h1>Runt: a proposed virtual machine specfication</h1>
<p>2016-10-14</p>
<p>In my recent efforts working with Polysporth, I found myself battling 
the scheme Garbage Collector when trying to implement callbacks. 
After many no-go efforts, I began scheming up a system that could
persitently hold procedures and call C functions. What came out was a creation
I call Runt. While no lines of actual C code have been written, I have thought out 
much of system in the writeup below. </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Runt is a stack-based, static memory, virtual machine to be written in ANSI C. </p>
<p>Some of the features may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stack based</li>
<li>Static Memory-pool: no calls to malloc needed</li>
<li>Forth-like language for parsing</li>
<li>Simple interface for adding words to dictionary</li>
<li>Built for polysporth: addition/alternative to tinyscheme 
  (use this for callbacks)</li>
<li>Procedure-based: emphasis on concatenive programming and abstraction, 
something not easily doable in Sporth.</li>
<li>interactive shell</li>
</ul>
<h2>Macros and typedefs</h2>
<pre><code> enum {
     RUNT_NOT_OK = 0,
     RUNT_OK = 1,
     RUNT_NIL = 0,
     RUNT_FLOAT,
     RUNT_STRING,
     RUNT_CELL
 };</code></pre>
<h2>Data structures</h2>
<h3>Pointer</h3>
<pre><code> typedef struct {
     runt_type type;
     void *ud;
 } runt_ptr;</code></pre>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<pre><code> typedef runt_int runt_proc (runt_vm *, runt_ptr);</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example of a procedure.</p>
<pre><code> static runt_int runt_add(runt_vm *vm, runt_ptr p)
 {
     if(runt_check_stack(rd, 2, &quot;ff&quot;) =! OK) return RUNT_NOT_OK;</code></pre>
<pre><code>     runt_stacklet *v1 = runt_pop(rd);
     runt_stacklet *v2 = runt_pop(rd);
     runt_stacklet *v3 = runt_push(rd);</code></pre>
<pre><code>     runt_float v1f = v1-&gt;p.f;
     runt_float v2f = v2-&gt;p.f;</code></pre>
<pre><code>     v3-&gt;f = v1f + v2f;
     return RUNT_OK;
 }</code></pre>
<h3>Cell</h3>
<pre><code> typedef struct {
     runt_proc proc;
     runt_ptr data;
     runt_uint psize;
 } runt_cell;</code></pre>
<h3>Stacklet</h3>
<pre><code> typedef struct {
     runt_ptr p;
     runt_float f;
 } runt_stacklet;</code></pre>
<h3>Stack</h3>
<pre><code> typedef struct {
     stacklet stack[MAX_SIZE];
     runt_int pos;
     runt_int size;
 } runt_stack;</code></pre>
<h3>List</h3>
<p>A <em>runt_entry</em> is a single link for a linked list. The init function is called
every time a new cell is added. </p>
<pre><code> typdef struct runt_list {
     runt_cell *cell;
     runt_proc init;
     struct runt_list *next;
 } runt_entry;</code></pre>
<pre><code> typedef struct {
     runt_int size;
     runt_entry root;
     runt_entry *last;
 } runt_list;</code></pre>
<h3>Dictionary</h3>
<pre><code> typedef struct {
     runt_int size;
     runt_list list[128];
 } runt_dict;</code></pre>
<h3>Pool</h3>
<pre><code> typedef struct {
     unsigned char *data;
     runt_uint size;
     runt_uint used;
 }</code></pre>
<h3>Main Data struct</h3>
<h2>VM functions</h2>
<h3>Pools</h3>
<p>Before Runt can call anything, the various memory pools must manually be created
and initialized. There are two memory pools in Runt: the <strong>cell pool</strong> and the
<strong>memory pool</strong>. The <strong>cell pool</strong> is space where procedures are stored, and
the <strong>memory pool</strong> is where cells can allocate data without having to worry
about freeing it. </p>
<p><em>runt<em>cell</em>pool_set</em> sets the cell memory pool</p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_cell_pool_set(runt_vm *vm, runt_cell *cell, runt_uint size);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt<em>cell</em>pool_init</em> after setting the cell pool, zeros out the cell pool (sets thing to nil)</p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_cell_pool_init(runt_vm *vm, runt_cell *cell);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt<em>memory</em>pool_set</em> sets the memory pool </p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_memory_pool_set(runt_vm *vm, unsinged char *buf, runt_uint size);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt_malloc</em> allocates memory from the pool. Returns (N + 1), the position in
the memory pool</p>
<pre><code> runt_uint runt_malloc(runt_vm *vm, size_t size, void **ud);</code></pre>
<h3>Cell operations</h3>
<p>Cells are the atomic unit in Runt. Inside every cell is a function and user
data associated with that cell. </p>
<p><em>runt<em>new</em>cell</em> gets a new cell from the cell pool.</p>
<pre><code> runt_uint runt_new_cell(runt_vm *vm, runt_cell \*\*cell);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt<em>link</em>cell</em> links a cell to another cell. used to call procedures </p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_link_cell(runt_vm *vm, runt_cell *src, runt_cell *dest);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt_bind</em> binds function + pointer data to cell</p>
<pre><code> runt_uint runt_bind(runt_cell *cell, runt_proc proc, runt_ptr data);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt_call</em> executes a single cell</p>
<pre><code> int runt_call(runt_vm *vm, runt_cell *cell);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt_exec</em> iterates through a contiguous group of cells determined of size
cell->psize</p>
<pre><code> int runt_exec(runt_vm *vm, runt_cell *cell);</code></pre>
<h3>Stack operations</h3>
<p><em>runt_pop</em> and <em>runt_push</em> pop and push stacklet pointsers on the stack. These
can then be read and written to. </p>
<pre><code> runt_stacklet * runt_pop(runt_vm *vm);
 runt_stacklet * runt_push(runt_vm *vm);</code></pre>
<h3>Pointers</h3>
<p><em>runt<em>mk</em>pointer</em> turns a void pointer into a runt pointer</p>
<pre><code> runt_ptr runt_mk_pointer(runt_type type, void *ud);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt<em>ref</em>to_cptr</em> takes an integer and gets the actual block of memory, filled
into ud. Returns RUNT<em>OK on sucess, RUNT</em>NOT_OK on failure.</p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_ref_to_cptr(runt_vm *vm, runt_uint ref, void **ud);</code></pre>
<h3>Dictionary</h3>
<p>Procedures added to Runt can be associated with a string keyword in something
called a dictionary. To make a word in a dictionary, you create an entry with
the C function and optional init function for allocation, then add this table
to the hash table.</p>
<p><em>runt<em>entry</em>create</em> allocates memory for a new entry from the memory pool,
then assigns the variables. What is returned is the reference. A value of
zero indicates failure.</p>
<pre><code> runt_uint runt_entry_create(runt_vm *vm, runt_cell *cell, runt_proc init, 
     runt_entry **entry);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt_word</em> adds a new word to the dictionary which points to an entry</p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_word(runt_vm *vm, 
     const char *name, 
     runt_int size, 
     runt_entry *entry);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt<em>word</em>search</em> looks for an entry in the dictionary</p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_word_search(runt_vm *vm, 
     const char *name, runt_int size, runt_entry **entry);</code></pre>
<h3>Lexing and parsing</h3>
<p>In addition to the VM, Runt has a Forth-like language built around it. These
are the functions needed. </p>
<p><em>runt_compile</em> compiles a string to cells</p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_compile(runt_vm *vm, const char *str);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt_lex</em> is called repeatedly. It parses each word in the string and returns
the type of the word. pos is updated to the position of the next word.</p>
<pre><code> runt_type runt_lex(runt_vm *vm, const char *str, 
    runt_int size, runt_int *pos);</code></pre>
<h3>Procedures</h3>
<p>Procedures int Runt do things. In Runt, every cell is a procedure, but cells
can also be grouped together as a procedure.</p>
<p><em>runt<em>proc</em>begin</em> starts a procedure. cells added to the cell pool will be
included in this procedure until <em>runt<em>proc</em>end</em> is called.</p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_proc_begin(runt_vm *vm, runt_cell *proc);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt<em>proc</em>end</em> closes a procedure being made.</p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_proc_end(runt_vm *vm);</code></pre>
<p><em>runt<em>proc</em>zero</em>  Is a dummy function that does nothing. It is the default
function in all cells, as well as the function you should pass </p>
<pre><code> runt_int runt_proc_zero(rung_vm *vm, runt_ptr p);
</code></pre>
