<h3># 9 ways to NRT, part 1: NRT and Echo</h3>
<p>2014-12-19</p>
<p>Welcome to part 1 of <em>9 Ways to NRT</em>!</p>
<p>Today, I'm going to demystify what this command means:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo "d4. r8 m2" | nrt 
</code></pre>

And explain what is being output by NRT.<h4>Piping</h4>
<p>A large of getting NRT to be powerful is through the use of pipes on linux with the
"|" character.
In this case we are piping some <a href="{% post_url 2014-12-19-nrt-syntax %}">nrt notes</a>
 to NRT with builtin echo command. </p>
<h4>Output</h4>
<p>Running our command should give the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo "d4. r8 m2" | nrt 
0,1.5,0
1.5,1.5,2
3,2,4
</code></pre>

NRT is taking our piped input and spitting out a text table of comma separated values.
There are three values on each line. These values are start time, duration, and note number. <p>Time printed in NRT is in seconds, and the implied BPM of NRT output is 60. (This means that
a half note is 0.5 seconds, a quarter note is 1 second, a half note is 2 seconds, etc..)
The best practice for changing the tempo is to have another program handle it.</p>
<p>The note number is an integer. Without any octave shifts, the notes drmfsltDRMFSLTD can produce 
an integer with the range of 0 and 24. These notes can be offset with a root MIDI note number 
The best practice is to have NRT output sent to another program to assign proper keys and ranges.</p>
