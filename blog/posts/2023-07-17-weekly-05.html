<h1>Weekly Update 5: Sculpting a Digital Vocal Tract</h1>
<p>2023-07-17</p>
<h2>Sculpting a Vocal Tract</h2>
<p>This week, I found myself sculpting a digital vocal tract.
You can see me sculpting it here (yes, there is sound):</p>

</p>
<p>The sculpter I built makes use of a <a href="/wiki/monome_grid">Monome Grid</a>
and the KN01 knob from BinePad (also known as the NeoKnob).
If the vocal tract can be imagined as a long tube, each row
on the Grid corresponds to a region on that tube. The rows
act as a kind of horizontal slider. As they get larger, the
region of that tube gets larger. Various configurations
of the regions produce geometries of the vocal tract that
"color" an incoming glottal signal going into it with
vowel-like timbres. Using the Grid gives me coarse tuning
of the tract shape, while the knob provides fine tuning.</p>
<p>This demonstrates one of the advantages to using this
particular technique of voice synthesis: malleability.
This is one of the only vocal synthesis techniques out
there that allows for this interactive kind of sound
shaping.</p>
<p>This is not the first time I've <a href="/wiki/vocshape">built such a thing</a>.
In fact, I built an interface for my Grid functionally
identical to this one back in 2021 for an earlier version
of my system. However, this latest iteration has a few
small quality of life improvements added to it. For starters,
it controls a better sounding vocal tract. There's also
some behind-the-scenes stuff that will make it easier for
me to build up sets of tract shapes, which can then be
used as phonemes for a babbling pseudo-language.</p>
<h2>A notebook of bitmap doodles</h2>
<p>At some point, I'd like to name these shapes and use the
Grid to display these names. The low density of the Grid
forces one to get creative. Letters take too much space,
so I figured I'd think logographically and design
symbols that can fit
the <a href="/blog/posts/2023-07-10-weekly-04.html">text editor for the Grid</a> I
made last week.</p>
<p>It's a work in progress, but here's my notebook sketching
out ideas and brainstorming. I think it showcases my typical
process pretty well:</p>
<p><img src="/res/weekly/bitmap_doodles.jpg" alt="Notebook of Bitmap Doodles" /></p>
<p>Even though these will eventually end up digital bits and pixels,
I find sketching things out by hand with ink is a better
impedance match for my brain: it moves closer to the rate at
which I think about things.</p>
<p>The thought process here moves top to bottom, left to right.</p>
<p>At the top of the left page, I start improvising 2x6 bitmap glyphs.
By the start of the second row, some ideas begin to form. I start
thinking about symbolically representing an upper and
lower path.</p>
<p>The second half of the left page, I switch to 2x4 bitmaps.
For some reason, something clicks, and I'm immediately
reminded of some of the Generative Kufic-style Calligraphy
projects I did a while back, such as <a href="/wiki/kuf">kuf</a> and
<a href="/wiki/trikuf">trikuf</a>. These dealt with a set of rules which
yielded aesthetically pleasing 1-bit tilesets, which is
exactly the sort of thing I want to do here.</p>
<p>The right page here, I'm thinking about rules, systems,
and organization. This is where things get a little unhinged.
I think I know now what I'm after: combinations of 2x4
tiles that form patterns that conform to some basic
aesthetic rules inspired by Kufic calligraphy.</p>
<p>I split the tile in half and rotate it. Instead of 2x4
columns, I now have 4x1 rows. Given a row, I want to know
all the valid rows that can come after it. My first instinct
was to try and draw this out as a tree structure because
I thought it'd be interesting. I should have known
that was going to be too tedious to do by hand. I give
up visualizing stuff, and start using terser notation. A
row can be split in half and turned into a base-4 number:
two numbers that are either 0, 1, 2, or 3. I start writing
down a table for this with an ad-hoc method. I give up after
a while.</p>
<p>At some point, it occurs to me that this is a Finite State
Machine, and I might benefit from writing the entire state
machine for just 2 bits instead of 4 bits. I drew
this out on the bottom on the right page. For any given
2-bit state, there are 3 possible "kufically correct" states
that can follow it. There's an elegance to that. Since
there's only 4 possible states, you could define an even
smaller table that shows what <em>can't</em> follow any given
state (which is 1 state instead of 3), and you could fit
it all in 16 bits.</p>
<p>I return to the 4-bit rows. I want an algorithm that
produces the possible rows for any given rows. I want to
try breaking it up into 2 smaller 2-bit states and using
the lookup table I just made. There are a maximum of 9
possible states, but only some of those will yield Kufic
correct results. The 4-bit row is split in half to make
2 2-bit rows, but there is a third 2-bit row in the middle
to consider as well.</p>
<p>The stuff in the center is me trying to shove things into
a 3x3 matrix because matrixes are neat, and define some adhoc
"math" notation that will tersely define the operations
I'm trying to do. The problem is, I just don't remember how
to do matrix operations, and I can't be bothered to look
it up. So what is there are scribbled attempts to express
what I've been doing manually as a formal algorithm. It
is incomplete, in a confusing state, but I think nearly done.</p>
<p>Hopefully when this is done, I'll have a re-usable system
for procedurally generating aesthetically pleasing symbols.</p>
