<h1>Kona and Sporth</h1>
<h2>On Kona</h2>
<p>Kona! What a language!</p>
<p>I first found <a href="http://www.github.com/kevinlawler/kona">Kona</a> half a year ago while 
looking up terse programming programming languages. I wanted to find languages 
that could be expressive in a 140-character tweet or less. I found myself intrigued with
the unusual aesthetics of Kona and the APL family of languages; there seemed to be
many musical applications. At the time, Kona touched upon abstractions of music that
I wasnt readly to deal with; <a href="/proj/soundpipe">Soundpipe</a> was in its infancy, and
<a href="/proj/sporth">Sporth</a> was not even born yet. I was still at the atomic level, and
more infrastructure needed to be laid out and realized.</p>
<h2>Kona and Sporth</h2>
<p>Kona (and K for that matter) has the distinction of being centered around "lists" 
and array-based processing. For me, that means </p>
<p>What I wanted from Kona was to be able to compile Kona code instead of Sporth
to generate ftable code.</p>
<p>When I first looked at the codebase for Kona, I was both in awe and horrified at
what I saw. Being fearless and determined, I jumped in and ended up being able to
implement their API in Sporth in under an hour. While the codebase is quite unusual,
it is quite consistent, and properly documented. </p>
<h2>Building Kona for Sporth</h2>
<p>At the moment, building Kona in Sporth is a little bit of a hack. Kona must be built before
compiling Sporth. Once that is done, you must enable it in config.mk and specify
where the Kona directory is. </p>
<h2>A Major Scale in Kona</h2>
<p>After a few days with Kona, I figured out how to build a major scale. 
The code looks like this:</p>
<p><pre><code>s:0 2 4 5 7 9 11;
do:{(s@(!x)!#s)+(12*((!x)%#s))};
do 24</code></pre>
</p>
<p>Some brief analysis:
<ul>
<li>'s' is our array</li>
<li>'do' is our function</li>
<li>'x' is a variable for length</li>
<li>(!x)!#s creates a orderded sequence (1, 2, 3, ...) of x size wrapped around length of #s 
s@ reaches for a particular index </li>
<li>(12 * ((!x)%#s))) adds octaves (every time it reaches the end of the array, add 12)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Kona to ftable</h2>
<p>At the moment, Kona code can only be used to generate Sporth ftables. 
Using the major scale kona code from above, we can build a sequencer using a
fm oscillator and a trigger-sequencer:</p>
<p><pre><code># Generate major scale
"maj" "s:0 2 4 5 7 9 11;do:{(s@(!x)!#s)+(12*((!x)%#s))+48};do 14" kona
<h1>cycle through generated table</h1>
<p>0.1 dmetro dup 0 pset</p>
</p>
<h1>frequency from tseq</h1>
<p>0 "maj" tseq mtof 
<h1>amplitude</h1>
<p>0.3 
<h1>carrier</h1>
<p>1 
<h1>randomized modulator</h1>
<p>0 p 1 4 trand floor
<h1>randomized mod index</h1>
<p>0 p 0 4 trand 
fm</code></pre></p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
<h2>Some Readings</h2>
<p>Here are some articles on K I found.</p>
<p>I believe that the K, and APL family of languages is worth looking into, even
if you don't plan on doing anything with it. It's chock-full of interesting 
people and ideas.</p>
