<h1>Goodbye blogging? Hello microblogging and wiki-ing?</h1>
<p>2020-07-27</p>
<p>I've never been great at blogging. Spent years trying to
make it a regular habit, and still I only do it sporadically.</p>
<p>Blog posts are a form of writing that is multi-paragraphed
and timestamped. In the tech blogging world, they usually
resemble articles rather more than personal logs. There are
very few things that I do that warrant a timestamped
multi-paragraph format. And because it's timestamped, it
usually means it is done in about one sitting. No multi-day
edits. It's a high barrier to entry for me. And for what
pay-off? Does anybody read this? Hello? Is this thing on?</p>
<p>Enter the personal wiki. Also known as a mind-map, this
interface enables one to freely write mini articles that are
hyperlinked together in a local network. For a little under
a year now, I've been developing my own <a href="/wiki">wiki</a> system
using C, SQLite, org-mode, and <a href="/wiki/janet">Janet</a> called
<a href="/wiki/weewiki">weewiki</a>. In that short period of time,
I've written 60 pages for it, which is more than the number
of blog posts I've written in the past 6 years!</p>
<p>I attribute the success of the wiki to two things:
incremental editing and the non-linear format. There are no
time stamps in weewiki. One can easily write a sentence or
two to start a page, and then come back to it later. Or not.
There is much less overhead needed to make a wiki page.
That's fine too. The hyperlinked nature of a wiki makes it
really suitable for non-linear thinking. It's actually very
hard to think of ideas/concepts in linear order all the
time. Writing a bunch of little ideas down, growing them,
and connecting them later is a much more organic process.</p>
<p>But, sometimes timelines <em>are</em> important and interesting.
Enter <a href="/wiki/twtxt">twtxt</a>, a dead-simple decentralized
microblogging alternative to twitter. For the past few
months, I've been off and on about this platform. In recent
weeks, I've been figuring out ways to integrate twtxt with
my weewiki engine. As a result, I've generated a HTMLized
<a href="/wiki/feed">feed</a> of my twtxt feed that is able to parse
org markup and dynamically generate references to pages
on my wiki page. Twtxt/weewiki integration is made possible
thanks to weewiki's built in scripting engine written in
Janet, as well as a script I wrote that converts
<a href="/wiki/twtxt_sqlite">twtxt files to SQLite</a>. More
experiments and documentation of this cross-pollination can
be found <a href="/wiki/twtxt_playground">here</a>.</p>
<p>Microblogging platforms like twtxt make an ideal pairing
with weewiki because it has timestamps. I also like how
little effort it takes to make a tweet. I wrote a little
<a href="/wiki/say">script</a> that makes it trivial to tweet something
from the commandline using
<a href="https://github.com/mdom/txtnish">txtnish</a>. It is useful to
have a medium used to encapsulate small ideas or
miscellanesous thoughts that wouldn't fit anywhere else.</p>
<p>So, that's that. So, is this the end of blogging for me?
In some ways, yes. The personal wiki has worked really
really well for me so far. I don't think I truly ever go
back to blogging. I don't know if there was ever much to go
back to. I also am optimistic. My making the wiki, I
think my blog gets to become more of a blog. That is to say,
a medium for contemporary information. Long form updates,
summarys, project announcements, etc. These all seem like
the sort of things suitable for blogs.</p>
<p>Let's meet again, dear reader, at the <a href="/wiki">wiki</a> and
the <a href="/wiki/feed">feed</a>.</p>
