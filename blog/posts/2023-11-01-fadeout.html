<h1>My Gradual Fade Away From Music</h1>
<p>2023-11-01</p>
<p>I thought it would be helpful to write down what I've
been feeling for a while now.</p>
<p>In a few days, I'll be 32 years old. I've been rethinking
some things. I've been having a rough time with
this "music technology as a career" thing. It's just not
working out the way I thought it would. I don't feel like
I made it. Bad choices? Bad luck? Probably a mix of both.</p>
<p>So, I'm pivoting. No more "Music Tech" career. Just "Tech".
Music is a crutch.</p>
<p>Music has been the cornerstone of my identity for over
2 decades. Recently, my relationship with Music has been
strained and distant. I've got a lot of bad feelings
associated with it. My 20s were full of smiling faces
taking stuff away from me, and I'm bitter and resentful
about it.</p>
<p>We'll see where music will belong in my life moving
forward. But, if I have to, I'm ready to let it go. I'm
tired.</p>
