<h1>Contrenot Conclusions</h1>
<p>2016-12-03</p>
<p>As the Stanford academic quarter wraps up, so must this project. It has been
quite the ride. Most of the functionality and assembly was done last week, so
this week was spenty tidying things up and making things nice. For starters,
I organized the <a href="http://wwww.github.com/paulbatchelor/contrenot">code</a> a little 
bit and made a <a href="/proj/contrenot">project page</a>.</p>
<h2>Painting</h2>

<p>The wood I used for the body was pretty cheap and shoddy, so I opted to 
spray paint it black. The pictures above show the contrenot being prepped for 
spray paint. Before spray painting, I took some time to smooth some of the edges
around the neck (no pictures of that unfortunately).</p>
<h2>Remounting</h2>
<p><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_conclusion/small/remounting.jpg" alt="Remounting and recoiling pull string" /></p>
<p>After the spray paint job, the components had to be mounted on. The sensor 
strips were a taped back onto the neck. </p>
<p>Next was the process of mounting and rewinding the pull string sensor, partially
seen in the picture above.</p>

<p>Next, the arduino was screwed on, along with the perfboard. </p>

<p>Then, the perfboard was wired into the arduino. Some effort was put into taping
down the wires and making it look a little more pretty. </p>
<h2>Sound design</h2>
<p>With the hardware finally out of the way, I could finally take a day and 
focus on making a few cool sounds for the instrument 
(written in <a href="/proj/sporth.html">Sporth</a>, naturally). The patches can be 
found <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/contrenot/tree/master/sporth">here</a>.</p>
<h2>final results</h2>
<p>Here is what the final instrument looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_conclusion/small/lean.jpg" alt="lean" /></p>
<p><img src="/res/blog/contrenot_conclusion/small/pull2.jpg" alt="pull2" />
<img src="/res/blog/contrenot_conclusion/small/pull.jpg" alt="pull" /></p>
<p>The pictures above show how the pullstring mechanism, which has gone through
many iterations since the <a href="/blog/posts/2016-11-15-strings-springs.html">initial prototype</a>. The most noticeable change 
is the switch from red string (too thin, and hard to see) to a porter-colored
2mm thick cord. </p>

So that's about it. All that's really left is to make videos of the actual 
thing being played, which will happen next week.
