<p>Live coding with Sporth and Vim</p>
<p>This past month, I've been working on improving live coding in Sporth. At the 
moment, these improvements only apply to Linux users who use JACK. If you happen
to fall in this category, read on...</p>
<h2>The Before Times</h2>
<p>Prior to this month, live coding in Sporth was a hacked together thing I did. 
After code re-evaluation was made possible in Sporth, 
I quickly wrote a small utility called "jacksporth" which not only could run
Sporth patches in realtime with JACK audio, but could also re-compile Sporth strings
via OSC. I used this utility with Vim and some shell scripts to create a live
coding environment for myself.</p>
<p>This worked well enough, but it had many limitations. Comments did 
not work and would "short circuit" and disable anything which came after it. 
The command line interface was really awkward, not utilizing any
command line flags from the standard sporth command line utility. jacksporth
had read a file, even it was nothing. </p>
<h2>The Better Times</h2>
<p>How do you make a Sporth live coding better? I will tell you, in bullet point
form:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>merge the "jacksporth" utility into the sporth CLI (as optional, of course)</p>
</li>
<li><p>add the sporth vim keybindings and shell scripts to the util folder instead of
a random folder on my computer</p>
</li>
<li><p>add an option to start sporth without a file</p>
</li>
<li><p>give the ability to change p-values over OSC</p>
</li>
<li><p>give the ability to process one channel of realtime audio input using the 
"in" ugen</p>
</li>
<li><p>give the ability to spawn multiple instances of sporth in realtime </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above improvements have made it much easier to get started live 
coding!</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Firstly, you'll need to make sure you have JACK and liblo installed. If 
you plan on using Vim, you'll need to ensure that you have installed oscsend, 
a commandline tool which should have come installed with liblo. All of these
dependencies are needed on top of the usual dependencies for Sporth.</p>
<p>Next, you'll need to enable jack. In config.mk, uncomment the line that says
"BUILD_JACK=1". Then run "make clean", "make", and "sudo make install"..</p>
<p>Inside the util folder, there is a file called sporth.vim. Place this in the
directory where you intend to do live coding.</p>
<h2>Running</h2>
<p>To start Sporth for live coding, go into the directory you plan to run code
on, and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code> sporth -b jack -c 2 -0</code></pre>
<p>Next, open up Vim and run ":so sporth.vim"(sporth.vim should be in 
the current working directory). </p>
<p>Now write some sporth code:</p>
<pre><code> (
 440 0.5 sine
 dup
 )</code></pre>
<p>This code can be evaluated by pressing space+s.</p>
<h2>Alternate instances of Sporth</h2>
<p>Any number of sporth instances can spawned. My current Sporth + Vim live coding
setup has key bindings for two instances. To start the alternate instance, run
this command:</p>
<pre><code> sporth -o alternate -p 6450 -b jack -c 2 -0</code></pre>
<p>This will create a jack client called "alternate", with an OSC server on 
port 6450. IIn the vim setup, code can be evaluated to this alternate instance 
with they keyboard shortcut space+l. </p>
<h2>Audio input</h2>
<p>The "in" ugen in Sporth has been overridden to take in one audio input from JACK.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<pre><code> in 0.8 0.75 dup delay 0.5 * + dup</code></pre>
<p>Adds a feedback delay to an input signal. Clock and gate signals also work in 
addition to audio signals. </p>
