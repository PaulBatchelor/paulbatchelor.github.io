  <p>NRT is a simple music notation system written with algorithmic composition and 
modularity in mind.</p>

<p>I do a lot of generative composition.  One of my techniques that I use is to 
take pre-written musical phrases and transform them somehow. However, getting these phrases
into a system of mine was always a tedious and unmusical task for me. If I wanted 
to input a melody like “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” into a program, I’d have
to write an array (many times by hand) with each note, the duration of the note, 
and when the note plays. It was a very time consuming process, and the resulting
array was something very hard to read and modify. I wanted to find a way to speed up
this input process.</p>

<p>I looked at a few options: MIDI, ABC notation, and Lilypond. While all great, these were all too
complicated and would only “kind of” work for my simple needs. 
All I wanted was a simple notation system that would give me Notes, 
Rhythms, and Timings. So I decided to try to make something myself. I took the first
letters of all the things I wanted in this program and called it NRT.</p>

<p>I’m currently halfway through a nine part blog series I’m writing called “9 ways to NRT”.
These will show how NRT can be used with other applications.</p>
