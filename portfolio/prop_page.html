  <p>Prop is a binary proportional rhythmic notation system. With it’s simple syntax,
prop can be used to notate complex rhythms. </p>

<p>Prop can be found on github <a href="https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/prop">here</a>.</p>

<p>In prop, absolute time is arbitrary. Once a prop pattern has been analyzed, it
is scaled based on the duration it is given. </p>

<p>Prop is a very simple syntax with only a few rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a ‘+’ is a note. </li>
  <li>a ‘-‘ is a rest.</li>
  <li>a positive integer <em>N</em> followed by parenthesis (ex: “2()”) will modify the
time scale of a prop pattern inside the parenthesis by a factor of N. For instance, {2(++)} will produce
a phrase twice as fast as {++}, 3(++) will produce a phrase three times as fast
as {++}, etc, etc.</li>
  <li>Parentheses can be encapsulated within eachother (ex: “{+2(+3(++))}”) </li>
  <li>The entire prop pattern must be encapsulated inside brackets</li>
  <li>Prop is whitespace insensitive. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cli">CLI</h2>

<p>The command-line interface, called “prp”, behaves very similarly to it’s sister
program NRT in that it is a text filter: prop patterns go in, text tables come out.</p>

<p>Prp has a text table of two values, the first being the start time of the note, and
the second value being the duration. The main idea behind this is that Prp can
be chained together with other Unix programs to create music. </p>

<p>In addition to creating text tables, Prop has the addtional option of generating
a visual representation of the prop pattern in postscript format. </p>

<p>Here are the possible flags to set:</p>

<p>-d <em>time</em> sets the duration (in seconds) of the prop pattern
-p <em>file</em> will write a visual representation in postscript format
to <em>file</em></p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>In order to better illustrate prop concepts, here are a few very simple
examples. The pattern is shown first, then their visualized output, followed by
their approximate musical equivalent in music notation, and then a description of what
is happening.</p>

<p>Ex 1: {+++}</p>

<p>Proportion:</p>

<p><img src="/res/prop/vprp1.png" /> </p>

<p>Musical equivalent: </p>

<p><img src="/res/prop/prp1.png" /> </p>

<p>In example 1, a given length is divided equally into thirds. </p>

<p>Ex 2: { +-+ }
Proportion:</p>

<p><img src="/res/prop/vprp2.png" /> </p>

<p>Musical equivalent: </p>

<p><img src="/res/prop/prp2.png" /> </p>

<p>In example 2, the length is divided up equally into thirds. </p>

<p>Ex 3: { +2(++) }</p>

<p>Proportion:</p>

<p><img src="/res/prop/vprp3.png" /> </p>

<p>Musical equivalent: </p>

<p><img src="/res/prop/prp3.png" /> </p>

<p>In example three, there are three notes, two of which are halved because they
are inside the 2(), thus becoming twice as fast as the first note. </p>

<p>Ex 4: { +3(+-2(++)) }</p>

<p>Proportion:</p>

<p><img src="/res/prop/vprp4.png" /> </p>

<p>Musical equivalent: </p>

<p><img src="/res/prop/prp4.png" /> </p>

<p>Example 4 demonstrates how parentheses can be nested to create complex rhythmic
structures. A single note is followed by a triplet pattern. Inside this pattern, 
one of the notes is divided further into 2 parts. </p>

<p>Ex 5: { 5(+ 2(-+) + 4(++++) +) 3(+2(++)+) }</p>

<p>Proportion:</p>

<p><img src="/res/prop/vprp5.png" /> </p>

<p>Musical equivalent: </p>

<p><img src="/res/prop/prp5.png" /> </p>

<p>This is a more complex example underscores Prop’s clarity in rhythmic organization.
It is perhaps easier to understand what is happening in the prop pattern than
in traditional notation. </p>
