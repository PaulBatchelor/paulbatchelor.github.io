<h3>1. Brainstorming (soon to be overview)</h3>

<p><a id="wm_015_0002"></a>A work in progress idea...
</p>
<p>The gist of this is to take a worgle program and export it
to a weewiki. From there, the weewiki can export the content
to HTML. Supplementary pages can also be added and linked.
</p>
<p>My core thinking is to be able to export every major header
to it's own page. It will have the name format <code>wm_PROG_ID</code>,
where <code>PROG</code> is the program number, and <code>ID</code> is the resource
ID.
</p>
<p>Every program generates a table of contents. It has the name
<code>wm_PROG_toc</code> where <code>PROG</code> is the program id.
</p>
<p>Worgmap will write stuff to a file that is supplied. It
could be the worgmap db, but not necessarily.
</p>
<p>In addition to appending stuff to the "wiki" table, a
reference table called <code>wm_ref</code> will be created, which links
worgmap page names to resource + program ids. Even though
this is information could be parsed in the page name, this
is a bit cleaner.
</p>
<p>In order for this to work, worgmap must be able to
dynamically recreate org code, given a section (or resource
id of a section). This functionality will be implemented in
worgmap core.
</p>
<p>Generating an org file is a a piecemeal operation. It is
created by stringing together a bunch headers, content, and
codeblocks to a string.
</p>
<p>When worgle generates the database, it recreates the headers
and subheaders to include their section number.
</p>
<p>Given a block reference, a code sub block can be printed.
Eventually, all references will have links to a special
generated codeblock page.
