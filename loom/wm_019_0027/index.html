<h3>5. The Bug modes</h3>

<p><a id="wm_019_0027"></a>Below are the various states of existence for a bug.
</p>
<p>SLEEP: the bug is dreaming, waiting for their turn. When
they awake, they are set to be in LISTEN mode.
</p>
<p>LISTEN: the bug is prepping to fire by listening to
the environment. When they are done. They are given
a delay time, and set to WAIT.
</p>
<p>WAIT: the bug is waiting to fire. When the counter
reaches zero, it will FIRE.
</p>
<p>FIRE: the bug is firing! The bug then resets the counter
with a new delay time. The bugs energy level will be
decreased by the decay factor. If the energy level goes
below a threshold, the bug is set to go back to SLEEP.
Otherwise, it will WAIT to fire again.
