<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p><a id="wm_020_0002"></a>SeqVM is a virtual machine designed for producing
procedurally generated sequences suitable for musical
purposes in modular environments.
</p>
<p>A VM is spawned inside of a node where it is clocked
by an audio rate signal. Every time the clock ticks,
the VM steps through commands until it reaches a halt
statement. These commands are used to write to output
signals, known as <code>channels</code>, which can then be
turned into audio rate signals.
