<h2>8. Correction Filters (WIP)</h2>

<p><a id="wm_018_0448"></a>Work in progress. Come back later.
</p>
<p>Some words on correction filters now. The idea is to take
some existing pattern (presumably hand created) and then
add modifications to make it comply with the technically
correct kufic rules.
</p>
<p>At the base level, is a correction to a quad. If it is
not a correct quad, it will pick a random tile to flip.
If the quad is still not correct, it will go set it back and
try all the tiles until a correct one occurs. A correct quad
will be ignored.
</p>
<p>Square correction happens next. This moves identical to a
generated square, correcting quads instead of generating
entirely new ones.
</p>
<p>Block correction works on 4 squares W, X, Y, Z.
</p>
<p>An arbitrarily sized set of blocks can be corrected by
creating a block (or maybe square?) filter that gradually
shifts through the canvas.
