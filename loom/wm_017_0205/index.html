<h3>8. Pattern Cell</h3>

<p><a id="wm_017_0205"></a>A pattern cell is a kind of cell that plays a rhythmic
pattern. It can have a maximum size of 32. When the VM
arrives on a pattern cell, it will begin playing the cell
pattern. It will remain on this cell until it reaches the
end of the pattern, then it will go to the next cell.
</p>
<p>A pattern cell can write to any of the 8 wires. It will use
the rightmost bit on the second byte to determine which wire
to write to. If no bits are turned on, it is assumed to be
wire 1.
</p>
<p>The counter is used to extract the corresponding bit state
in a way you'd typically expect. When the counter reaches
the end of pattern, it returns the next position in the
series, with loopback if appropriate.
</p>
<p>A pattern cell uses the global counter variable to maintain
state. If the counter is at -1, it assumed that the VM just
arrived at the pattern, and uses this to initialize the
counter to be 0.
</p>
<p>A bit of bitwise magic is used to determine the rightmost
bit of the third byte (<code>x & -x</code>) was retrieved from the book
"hackers delight" in the section called "the basics".
</p>
<p>Wire number from the byte gets converted to a wire position
<code>wp</code> using a sort of log2 while-loop function.
</p>
<p>The fourth command byte is used for additional
functionality. The byte is divided up into 2 nibbles.
The lower nibble determines the command, the upper
nibble defines the data. This is done because it will
show up command, data on the monome.
</p>
<p>If the command nibble is 0, nothing happens.
</p>
<p>Nibble command 1 enables switch mode. It will split
the pattern into 2 16-bit sections. It will reading from
the wire specified in the nibble data. A zero value will'
select the lower half pattern. A non-zero value selects the
upper half pattern. The wire data is specified as a binary
value.
