<h3>7. Meta Page Generation</h3>

<p><a id="wm_015_0154"></a>Metapages are pages that are dynamically generated using
SQL queries. These include a table of contents, a block
tree, and block pages.
</p>
<p>A table of contents page generates a list of links for all
the sections and subsections. Each section links to a page,
and every subsection links to it's major section page with
a jump link.
</p>
<p>Indentation will easier visibility, however the HTML will
be abstracted away into inline janet functions, should this
code ever want to be exported to a non-HTML format someday.
This is TBD.
</p>
<p>A block tree is like a table of contents, but it outlines
the code block hierachy in the program structure. Each of
these blocks link to block pages.
</p>
<p>Block pages give meta information about each block and where
they are located. This will include links to every subblock.
