<h2>2. How To Read This Document</h2>

<p><a id="wm_024_0004"></a>This document is a literate program, meaning that
both documentation and code are melted together in
one format (in this case, an org file). With any luck,
the words thrown around here will provide a coherent
explanation for the overall program structure.
</p>
<p>This text is well suited for an audience that wishes
to understand how GestVM the Program fundamentally works.
Unfortunately, for those who want to learn how actually
<b>use</b> GestVM, this may be the wrong place to start.
Hopefully, some tutorials and example files have been
included in the distribution.
</p>
<p>This document was written using the literate programming
features in org-mode, and tangled to C code with a custom
tangler. Emacs is a convenient way to browse this document
as it folds everything up into sections. In an HTML version
of this document, making use of the <a href="/loom/gestvm">table of contents</a> may be a helpful map.
</p>
<p>The structure of this document was written with the idea
that it could be mostly read top to bottom. Some sections,
such
as <a href="/loom/wm_024_0040#wm_024_0040">5. Structs</a> and <a href="/loom/wm_024_0021#wm_024_0021">4. Tangled Files</a>, are more code
than words. These are necessary for the program, but do not
need as much time.
</p>
<p>GestVM is largely a DSP algorithm. Reading
through <a href="/loom/wm_024_0006#wm_024_0006">3. Signal Flow</a> will
provide a good overall
understanding for how the program works. The computation
of a sample can be found in <a href="/loom/wm_024_0071#wm_024_0071">7. Top-Level Computation</a>. Starting
there at <code>gestvm_tick</code> and working
downwards may be a fruitful path. Other sections will
go through these in more detail.
</p>
<p>The key DSP algorithm used here is known as the <code>rephasor</code>,
and this algorithm is implemented and explained
in <a href="/loom/wm_024_0078#wm_024_0078">8. The General Rephasor Algorithm</a>. This algorithm
comes from the Sndkit collection, where there is a more
in-depth explanation.
</p>
<p>The interface to GestVM is via the Uxn virtual machine. This
is all explained in <a href="/loom/wm_024_0174#wm_024_0174">11. Uxn Evaluator</a>. Note that
an explanation of the Uxn VM itself is beyond the scope of
this document.
