<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p><a id="wm_018_0002"></a>Kuf is a library for procedurally generating tesselation
patterns stylistically similar to square kufic calligraphy.
</p>
<p>Kufic is a style of arabic script often used for
Quran transcription and architecture. Square Kufic is a
style that reduces the form to tessellation patterns that
reside on a square grid. Square Kufic is a more abstract
form of Kufic, usually used in more decorative and artful
contexts.
</p>
<p>The goal of Kuf is to provide a set of helpful tools for
generating asemic Kufic. There is no intention to add
features for any Arabic script, or any real writing system
for that matter. Kuf is aesthetics only.
</p>
<p>There are two parts to Kuf. The first part is building a
system that can generate patterns that are technically
correct Kufic patterns. The rules for "valid" Kufic patterns
are simple, so this is a bounded problem. The second part
involves generating aesthetically correct patterns. This
part builds on the first part, and aims to try and improve
results. Aesthetics are an unbounded problem, and to make
matters more complicated, it is often a subjective full of
contradictions here. Kuf will humbly try to navigate this
world and come up with some simple strategies for
reasonble looking output.
</p>
<p>With that out of the way, on to some constructs.
