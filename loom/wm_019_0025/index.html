<h3>4. What's in a bug?</h3>

<p><a id="wm_019_0025"></a>A "bug" has the following internal parameters:
</p>
<p>An integer variable used to indicate the current state.
</p>
<p>An unsigned integer used as a counter.
</p>
<p>A floating point variable is used to store the current
grain position, normalized 0-1. This is used to calculate
the buffer playhead position, as well as the envelope window
position.
</p>
<p>A floating point buffer is used to store audio information.
This is allocated to be a maximum size (externally known,
as every grain will have the same max size).
</p>
<p>The current buffer size is stored as an unsigned integer.
This is in units of samples, and must be greater than 0
and less than or equal to the max samples.
</p>
<p>A floating point value containing the "energy" level, which
is a value between 0 and 1. Every time the bug fires off,
the energy level decays by some factor (determined by the
decay parameter).
