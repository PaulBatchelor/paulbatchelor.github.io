<h2>11. Stepping Through The Ramp Tree</h2>

<p><a id="wm_021_0669"></a>A big part of gest involves stepping through a ramp tree.
A ramp tree produces a set of normalized ramp values
from 0 to 1, whose period lengths are proportional
to the external conductor signal. These values
can then be used to interpolate between targets.
</p>
<p>The ramp tree value is computed with <code>ramptree_step</code>.
It requires an instance of gest <code>g</code>, the estimated
increment amount for the sample <code>inc</code>, a <code>reset</code>flag to indicate if the conductor signal reset,
and the audio block buffer position <code>blkpos</code>, used to
schedule events that want sample-accurate timing
precision.

<h3>11.1. Beat Check-in</h3>

<p><a id="wm_021_0687"></a>In order to combat clock drift, a phrase "checks in" every
time conductor signal resets, which is an indicator of the
new beat. Every time a new beat occurs, the status of the
phrase is figured out, and handled accordingly.
</p>
<p>Clock drift naturally occurs within Gest because it
resynthesizes a new timing signal based on the external
conductor signal. Left unchecked, Gestures will eventually
fall out of time with the conductor due to the fact that
they are marching to the beat of their own drum.
</p>
<p>The coarse way that clock drift is managed is by keeping
drift localized within the phrase. A phrase is allocated
to be a fixed number of beats. When the conductor goes
on to the next beat, the current phrase, wherever it may
be in its performance, is discarded, and the clock drift
debt is reset.
</p>
<p>Gestures are a game of constant imprecision. Their timing
can either be late or early, but never quite on time.
Early gestures occur when a
phrase finishes before the conductor. When this happens, it
is told to wait, returning 1 until the first downbeat of the
next phrase. Late
phrases don't quite make it to the end of their gesture.
When this happens, the phrase bails and jumps to the next
one. The hope is that they are close enough to prevent an
audible glitch.
</p>
<p>During the check-in, the ideal position, obtained from
the beat counter and known as the <code>goal</code>,
can be compared with the actual position <code>t</code>. These two
values can be used to create a course correction factor,
which allows the gesture to slow down or speed up to more
closely match the conductor signal.
</p>

<h3>11.2. Setting the Output</h3>

<p><a id="wm_021_0696"></a>The point of this function is to update the overall state of
the ramp trees in gest and return a corresponding ramp
value.
</p>
<p>The returned value is the computation done on the previous
call to <code>ramptree_step</code>.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;set_the_output&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>out = g-&gt;phs;</pre></code>

<h3>11.3. Updating Targets</h3>

<p><a id="wm_021_0701"></a>A set <code>targetondeck</code> flag will not only be
used to change the target, but also the state information
that comes with the target, such as the node, the phrase,
and the conductor modifier associated with the target.
</p>
<p>It is also here that the next node is found. Information
for the next node needs to be immediately available, as
certain tools using and extending gest (such as the vocal
tract interpolation work) rely on knowing about
the next target for it to work properly.
</p>
<p>It is assumed that by the time <code>targetondeck</code> is found,
the next node is already in place (presumably
from the last time targetondeck was set, or initialization),
and just needs to be swapped in.
</p>
<p><code>please_wait</code> is cached as state, and gets turned on during
<code>find_next_node</code>.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;update_targets&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>if (g-&gt;targetondeck) {
    gest_state *s;

    s = &g-&gt;nxtstate;

    g-&gt;targetondeck = 0;

    if (s-&gt;please_wait) {
        g-&gt;please_wait = 1;
        return 1.0;
    }

    g-&gt;num = s-&gt;num;
    g-&gt;den = s-&gt;den;
    s-&gt;target-&gt;curbehavior = s-&gt;behavior;
    set_curtarget(g, s-&gt;target, blkpos);

    set_curnode(g, s-&gt;node);
    g-&gt;phrase_selected = s-&gt;phrase;

    init_state(&g-&gt;nxtstate);

    if (g-&gt;curnode != NULL) {
        find_next_node(g, g-&gt;curnode, &g-&gt;nxtstate);
    }

    g-&gt;nxttarget = g-&gt;nxtstate.target;

    if (g-&gt;nxttarget != NULL) {
        g-&gt;nxtval = g-&gt;nxttarget-&gt;value;
    } else {
        g-&gt;nxtval = g-&gt;curval;
    }
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>What triggers <code>targetondeck</code>? Usually this happens when the
internal ramp reaches the end. This can also be triggered
during the beat check-in, when a conductor signal demands
to jump to the next phrase before fully finishing the
current one.
</p>

<h3>11.4. Updating the phase using modifier and friends</h3>

<p><a id="wm_021_0707"></a>To begin, the modifier amount is calculated.
</p>
<p>The modifier and increment amount are used together to
update the existing phase.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;update_phase&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>{
SKFLT i;
SKFLT myinc;

if (g-&gt;phrase_selected-&gt;skew == NULL) {
    myinc = inc;
} else {
    myinc = g-&gt;phrase_selected-&gt;skew(g-&gt;t, inc);
}

i = myinc * ((SKFLT)g-&gt;num / g-&gt;den);
phs += i;
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>The phase is then checked to see if it has exceeded 1.
If it has, a change in nodes is required.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;check_and_update&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>if (phs &gt; 1.0) {
&lt;&lt;goto_next_node&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;wraparound&gt;&gt;
}</pre></code>

<h3>11.5. Signalling to go to the next target</h3>

<p><a id="wm_021_0720"></a>When the ramp reaches the end, it is time to go on to the
next node with a target. By the time it reaches this point,
this node has already been found, and just needs to be
signalled to switch with the variable <code>targetondeck</code>.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;goto_next_node&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>g-&gt;targetondeck = 1;</pre></code>

<h3>11.6. Finding the next node in the Ramp Tree</h3>

<p><a id="wm_021_0725"></a>When a new node begins, the next with a target
in the ramp tree must be found immediately after.
Many programs using Gest require knowing the next target.
</p>
<p>The next node is found by traversing the Ramp
Tree based on the position the current node is in.
</p>
<p>The process of finding the next node is done in a function
called <code>find_next_node</code>. It will find the next node, and
store the results in an instance of <code>gest_state</code>. The
<code>top</code> node is expected to be the currently selected node
<code>curnode</code>.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;static_funcdefs&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>static void find_next_node(gest_d *g,
                           gest_node *top,
                           gest_state *state);</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>The control flow of traversal starts large (checking
between phrases), and gets smaller (parent nodes, sibling
nodes).
</p>
<p>To begin, check and see if the next node happens to be in
the next phrase. That would mean the currently selected
node is the right-most node (no nodes after it)
in the top of the tree. If this is true, it is time to
<b>wait</b> for the next phrase on the next down beat. If the
next phrase is being found here, it has arrived a tad too
early (which is actually better than being a
tad too late, as it turns out. It's one or the other here).
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;reset_and_wait_for_next_phrase&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>/* next node is in next phrase */
phrase = next_phrase(g, phrase);
phrase = get_phrase(g, phrase);

if (phrase != NULL) next = phrase-&gt;top;
else next = NULL;

g-&gt;num = 1;
g-&gt;den = 1;

if (next != NULL) {
    next = dive_to_target(g, next);
}

please_wait = 1;</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Alternatively, if there are still nodes in the top-level
node, go there instead.
</p>
<p>TODO: do we need to handle edge case when next node is
monoramp with a modifier greater than 1? We are doing
that when finding sibling nodes.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;goto_next_child_in_top_node&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>next = top-&gt;next;

if (next-&gt;target == NULL) {
    next = dive_to_target(g, next);
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>If it's not the top of the tree, there is a general check
to see if the current node is the right-most node relative
to the position in the tree. If so, the node reverts the
global modification it did, and goes up one level to the
parent node to check the next node there.
</p>
<p>It may be a little bit confusing to see the parent node
getting reverted and not the selected node. Parent nodes
are the ones that apply their rhythmic influence, not the
selected nodes. When the parent reverted, it reverts the
global modifier to a state when the parent node was a child
node to another node.
</p>
<p>There is an edge case when selected nodes do actually
influence things: if the selected node is a monoramp with
a value greater than 1, it will actually be scaling the
phasor, as it needs to "eat" up beats in the polyramp
it is a child of. These kinds of nodes will need to be
reverted.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;goto_parent_node&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>/* if top is a monoramp &gt;1, revert it */
if (top != last_reverted) {
    if (top-&gt;type == NODE_MONORAMP && top-&gt;modifier &gt; 1) {
        /* revert the monoramp */
        revert_modifier(g, top);
    }
}

revert_modifier(g, top-&gt;parent);
last_reverted = top-&gt;parent;
top = top-&gt;parent;</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, the next node is found, and the program recursively
dives into it to find the next target, applying modifiers
along the way. Before that happens, the current node <b>may</b>need to revert the global modifier if it is a monoramp
with a modifier greater than 1.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;find_next_node_with_target&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>next = top-&gt;next;

/* if top is a monoramp &gt;1, revert it */

if (top != last_reverted) {
    if (top-&gt;type == NODE_MONORAMP && top-&gt;modifier &gt; 1) {
        /* revert the monoramp */
        revert_modifier(g, top);
    }
}

/* dive_to_target applies modifiers */
/* continguous nodes on the same level don't have these */
if (next-&gt;target == NULL) {
    next = dive_to_target(g, next);
} else if (next-&gt;type == NODE_MONORAMP && next-&gt;modifier &gt; 1) {
    /* next node is on same level but is monoramp */
    apply_modifier(g, next);
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>If the next node happens to be a monoramp with a modifier
greater than 1, it will also apply modifications. But should
be handled inside of <code>dive_to_target</code>. If the node is already
a target with a monoramp >1, this gets applied here as a
special exception.

<h3>11.7. When a phrase is over, wraparound</h3>

<p><a id="wm_021_0766"></a>A phrase is considered over when it reaches the end of the
top-level polyramp. At this point, the next phrase is found
and set to be the beginning of that node.
</p>
<p>All ramps begin exactly at 0. When wraparound happens,
the roundoff error is stored in the error variable (note:
no, it isn't. we are truncating, and I believe this is done
to prevent certain kinds of discontinuities. There are
checks in place for this).
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;wraparound&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>while (phs &gt; 1) phs--;
phs = 0; /* just kidding, truncate */</pre></code>

<h3>11.8. Spillover</h3>

<p><a id="wm_021_0771"></a>In situations where phrases do not quite
finish, but are mostly there (referred to as <code>undershoot</code>),
<code>spillover</code> can be applied. This is a special mode that
allows phrases to finish up in the next phrase.
Spillover is used to solve the discontinuities caused
by undershoot. However, too much spillover can cause timing
issues with other phrases. By default, spillover is
disabled.
</p>
<p>The amount of spillover a gesture can have is determined by
a value called <code>tolerance</code>. Tolerance is a value between 0
and 1, and should be a small value very close to or at zero.
The greater the value is, the more spillover can happen.
</p>
<p>Spillover behavior is determined via the spillover flag.
</p>
<p>The spillover flag gets turned on during the beat checkin
when the undershoot is within the tolerance level of being
completed. Instead of going to the next phrase, it will
resume as-is until it reaches the end of the phrase.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;turn_on_spillover&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>if (g-&gt;squawk) {
    fprintf(stderr, "spillover turned on\n");
}
g-&gt;spillover = 1;

&lt;&lt;please_wait_in_spillover&gt;&gt;</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>The spillover flag gest turned off when the phrase has
ended and is ready to go to the next phrase. At this
point, the <code>please_wait</code> flag should be turned on. When
the spillover and wait flags have both been enabled, gest
will do what it would have done during the beat checkin and
go to the next phrase. It will do this immediately and not
wait for the next beat.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;check_spillover&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>if (g-&gt;please_wait && g-&gt;spillover) {

    /* Copied and pasted from beat-checkin code */
    /* may want to wrap this in a function later */
    g-&gt;beat = 0;
    g-&gt;t = 0;
    g-&gt;phs = 0;
    g-&gt;please_wait = 0;
    g-&gt;correction = 1.0;
    g-&gt;targetondeck = 1;
    g-&gt;phrase_selected = g-&gt;nxtstate.phrase;

    g-&gt;spillover = 0;
    /* reset if next state was told to wait */
    /* TODO: is this needed here? */
    g-&gt;nxtstate.please_wait = 0;

    if (g-&gt;squawk) {
        fprintf(stderr, "spillover turned off.\n");
    }

    return phs;
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>In Spillover mode, beat check-in is skipped entirely;
there is hardly a need for it, so it is ignored.
</p>

<h3>11.9. edge case: please_wait flag in beat check-in</h3>

<p><a id="wm_021_0783"></a>Here's a weird edge case: the phrase finishes and
the <code>please_wait</code> flag is set one sample before the clock
reset. When this happens, a single sample discontinuity will
be returned. Why?
</p>
<p>When computing the ramptree, beat-checkin happens before
the <code>please_wait</code> flag is checked. In most scenarios,
<code>please_wait</code> is unset by the time it reaches here. But,
because it happened exactly one sample before, the internal
phasor value has been wrapped back to 0 from the previous
call. This ends up returning the equivalent of target A
instead of target B, which is wrong.
</p>
<p>To correct this, things must be configured so that the
returned value is 1 instead of 0, based on the state of
<code>please_wait</code> in the beat check-in when the check-in
discovers it has started the next phrase. There are 2
places to check the flag.
</p>
<p>The usual place is right about where gest would squawk
about undershoot. The local variable <code>phs</code> gets set to be 1.
After some re-init for the next node, this value of gets
returned.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;please_wait_in_undershoot&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>if (g-&gt;please_wait) {
    if (g-&gt;squawk &gt; 1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "please_wait set in undershoot\n");
    }
    phs = 1.0;
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>When the <code>spillover</code> flag gets turned on, <code>please_wait</code> will
need to be checked too. Normally, the program is used to
waiting a few samples before <code>please_wait</code> is set. But in
this edge case, it will only spill over into the next
sample.
</p>
<p>In this situation, the internal phasor value is set to be
1.0 in addition to returning 1.0, which is needed for
the next sample iteration.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;please_wait_in_spillover&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>if (g-&gt;please_wait) {
    if (g-&gt;squawk) {
        fprintf(stderr, "spillover: please_wait already on\n");
    }
    g-&gt;phs = 1.0;
    return 1.0;
}</pre></code>
