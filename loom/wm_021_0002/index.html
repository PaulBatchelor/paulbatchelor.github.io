<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p><a id="wm_021_0002"></a>Gest is a sequencer for gesture.
</p>
<p>Gest lies somewhere between a classical step sequencer and
an automation curve generator. The goal of Gest is to be a
better LFO.
</p>
<p>To understand how Gest works, a few terms will be described.
</p>
<p>Gest synthesizes <code>Gestures</code>: audio-rate control signals
intended to be mapped to parameters of other unit
generators in a modular synthesis environment. The overall
goal of Gest is to be able to use it as a way to add more
layers of nuance to computer-performed music, in
particular, lyrical music.
</p>
<p>Similar to a step sequencer, Gest is clocked by an exernal
signal, known as a <code>conductor</code> signal. This signal is
expected to be a <code>phasor</code> signal, a periodic rising ramp
signal going from 0 to 1. Once instantiated with a
conductor signal, Gest can then be programmed to perform
Gestures.
</p>
<p>A phasor is a continuous timing source. Not only does it
mark out pacing, but also position within a beat. Every
full ramp from 0 to 1 is a period, referred to as a <code>beat</code>of time.
</p>
<p>Gestures are created in sequences of chunks. A single chunk
is known as a <code>phrase</code>. A phrase takes up duration measured
in beats from the conductor signal. The phrase analyzes the
conductor, and resynthesizes a new slower signal: a single
ramp going from 0 to 1 spannign the whole duration of the
phrase. This signal is called a <code>monoramp</code>. The monoramp
acts a blank canvas to make rhythms with. A monoramp can be
equally divided up into an arbitray number of smaller
ramps, known as a <code>polyramp</code>. Contiguous ramps in a
polyramp can be fused backtogether in monoramps, and then
more polyramps can be made from those. This builds a tree
hierarchy of ramps with various subdivisions, known as a
<code>ramp tree</code>.
</p>
<p>The end leaves of the Ramp Tree are capped with what is
known as a <code>target</code>. A target is a scalar value. Using the
ramps from the Ramp Tree, consecutive targets are
interpolated together to generate a contiguous line
segment. The way segments travel from target A to B is
known as a <code>behavior</code>. Behaviors can be any number of
things, including linear, exponential, or step.
