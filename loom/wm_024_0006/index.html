<h2>3. Signal Flow</h2>

<p><a id="wm_024_0006"></a></p>

<h3>3.1. Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_024_0007"></a>GestVM can be imagined as a DSP algorithm whose state
is controlled via a virtual machine that gets periodically
evaluated. Understanding the signal flow is the recommended
way to understand the system.
</p>
<p>GestVM can be broken up into components,
which will be presented in flow order going from the inputs
to the outputs.
</p>
<p>Examined as a unit generator, GestVM takes in one input
signal, known as a <code>conductor</code>, and produces one output
signal, known as a <code>gesture</code>.
</p>

<h3>3.2. Temporal Weight (pre-input)</h3>

<p><a id="wm_024_0009"></a>The tempo of the timing signal can be optionally
influenced by the system it is controlling in a mechanism
called <code>temporal weight</code>.
</p>
<p>Temporal weight is the means for adding tempo flucuations.
In a typical DAW, tempo is controlled via a tempo automation
track. This will cause the length of notes to vary depending
region you drop them in. Temporal weight reverses this
relationship. It is instead the notes themselves that can
influence the tempo rather than the other way around.
</p>
<p>Temporal weight has two parameters: mass and inertia. As
mass increases, overall tempo increases and things become
faster. As mass decreases, overal tempo decreases and
things become slower. Inertia sets how quickly the sytem
will react to changes.
</p>

<h3>3.3. Conductor (input signal)</h3>

<p><a id="wm_024_0011"></a>The Conductor is a specialized timing signal used
to control the gesture. It is expected to be a periodic
rising ramp normalized to be in range 0 to 1. Ideally,
wraparound should be truncated.
</p>
<p>This is generated externally and not managed by GestVM.
The advantage of this is that this signal can be used to
control other things in a system, thus keeping things
synchronized.
</p>

<h3>3.4. Temporal Skewer</h3>

<p><a id="wm_024_0013"></a>Temporal skewing is a process that allows a section
beats produced by the conductor to be warped locally without
adding or removing any overall time.
</p>
<p>Skewing works by putting the conductor ramp through a
process that makes it proportionally slower, putting that
through some kind of slope function, then speeding it
up again.
</p>
<p>Skewing has two main parameters: the skewing behavior type
(such as bypass, exponential positive, exponential
negative), and the duration (positive integer, minimum 1).
</p>

<h3>3.5. Main Rephasor</h3>

<p><a id="wm_024_0015"></a>Placed after the Skewer, the Rephasor is the
component in charge of taking the input conductor signal
and proportionally changing the tempo.
</p>
<p>The rephasor is parametrically controlled with 2 values: a
numerator, and a denominator (positive integer values, at
least 1).
These produce a fraction which
set the scaling amount for the rephasor. A value of 1/2
(N<code>1, D</code>2) will produce a phasor at half speed. A value of
3/1 (N<code>3, D</code>1) will produce a phasor three times as fast.
</p>

<h3>3.6. Virtual Machine</h3>

<p><a id="wm_024_0017"></a>The <code>Virtual Machine</code> is placed after the Rephasor, and is
responsible for manipulating the state of the gesture
synthesizer. Every time the Rephasor resets back to 0, it
will make a call to the underlying machine, which will run
until it reaches a breakpoint statement <code>BRK</code>.
</p>

<h3>3.7. Interpolator (output)</h3>

<p><a id="wm_024_0019"></a>The <code>interpolator</code> takes in a rephasor as input, and uses it
to interplate between two values, the current value, and the
next value. Current value is set implicitly. The VM only
is able to set the next value. Every time the VM evaluates,
the existing next value is stored as the current value.
</p>
<p>The way the value is interpolated is known as
the <code>behavior</code>. Behaviors can include: linear, step,
exponential, etc. The interpolator can also be configured
to return things like the phasor signal itself, which allows
the gesture to be used for more articulation and envelope
purposes.
</p>
<p>Interpolator has 2 commands: set up the next value, and
the behavior.
