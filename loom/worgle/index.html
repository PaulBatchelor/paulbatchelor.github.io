<h1>Worgle and Friends (Woven Programs)</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This document aims to provide a summary for the
woven output program Worgle and the components.
</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/worgle">Worgle</a> is a fast and portable tangler for
literate programs written in noweb-styled org.
It aims to parse a small subset of org markup,
and also adds a few unique features as well.
</p>
<p>Worgle outperforms the native <code>org-tangle</code> found
in emacs by <b>several</b> orders of magnitude.
A simple benchmark test is provided in the project that
provides the following results from a mid-2015 MacBook pro
(no, it's not a typo):
</p>
<pre><code>$ bash measure_performance.sh
Org-babel-tangle (via Emacs): 0m36.806s
Worgle: 0m0.002s
Org-export-to-html (via Emacs): 1m21.955s
Sorg: 0m0.004s</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>(Note: Worgle's great performance as a tangler has less to
do with it being well designed, and more to do with
org-tangle being terribly designed.)
</p>

<h3>Main Program</h3>

<p>The <a href="/loom/worgle_main">main program</a> contains most of
the program. In fact, this document can be compiled by
itself if the <code>WORGLITE</code> C flag is defined, which creates
a simplified version of worgle called <code>worglite</code>. Worglite
has most of the functionality of Worgle, with a few
exceptions (most notably, database export is disabled).
</p>
<p>Worglite is used as part of the bootstrapping process; it
can be tangled into C code using <code>orgle</code>, a 700-line
org tangler written directly in ANSI C rather than a
literate program. Worglite is then used to tangle and build
the rest of components that make up Worgle.
</p>

<h3>SQLite Database Export</h3>

<p>One thing that Worgle can do that org-mode cannot do is
<a href="/loom/worgle_db">export itself to a SQLite database</a>,
where it can be further parsed in analyzed, in particular
by <code>worgmap</code>.
</p>

<h3>Sorg</h3>

<p><a href="/loom/sorg">Sorg</a> is a very simple org to HTML
converter that can be used to weave small worgle programs in
a pinch. It isn't really maintained anymore. Using worgmap's
weewiki export feature is a more robust option and ideal
for larger programs.
</p>

<h3>Worgmap</h3>

<p><a href="/wiki/worgmap">Worgmap</a> is a collection of small
utilities designed to analyze and do stuff with databases
generated by Worgle. The most useful interfaces by far are
the <code>weewiki</code> export (used to generated this
loom) and <code>get</code> programs (useful for getting insights
about a program).
</p>
<p>Worgmap itself is broken into smaller components, described
below.
</p>

<h4>CLI</h4>

<p>The <a href="/loom/worgmap_cli">Worgmap CLI</a> is a the main entry
paint, and in charge of making calls to all other programs.
</p>

<h4>Core</h4>

<p>The <a href="/loom/worgmap_core">core</a> provides an API for common
operations to do on a Worgle database. This is basically a
thin abstraction on top of the SQLite3 C API.
</p>

<h4>Get</h4>

<p>The <a href="/loom/worgmap_get">get</a> utility is a command-line
interface useful for doing some basic querying. It was
mainly written as a way to initially test the core API.
</p>

<h4>WeeWiki</h4>

<p>The <a href="/loom/worgmap_weewiki">weewiki</a> utility is used to
dynamically export a worgle database to a weewiki database.
This leverages the <a href="/loom/orgparse">org parser in weewiki</a> to generate HTML rather than
duplicating the parsing task there.
</p>
<p>This utility is what is used to construct the Loom.
</p>

<h4>Dot</h4>

<p>The <a href="/loom/worgmap_dot">dot</a> utility constructs a dot
graph out of a worgle program. This hasn't been used in a
while, and may need some updates.
