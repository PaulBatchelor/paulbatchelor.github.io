<h2>3. Constructs</h2>

<p><a id="wm_018_0018"></a></p>

<h3>3.1. Tile</h3>

<p><a id="wm_018_0019"></a>The atomic construct of a Kufic pattern is the <code>tile</code>. A
tile can be filled or unfilled. The most important thing in
square Kufic is that there a balance of filled and
unfilled tiles. More on this later.
</p>
<p>A tile is a lot like a bit in computer science. For
convenience, tiles will be stored as bits in unsigned
integers. 8-bit and 16-bit integers will mostly be used,
with 32-bit integers maybe being used in the future for
larger constructs.
</p>

<h3>3.2. Pair</h3>

<p><a id="wm_018_0021"></a>Two tiles form what is known as a <code>pair</code>. Kufic patterns are
2-dimensional, so pairs can be horizontal or vertical.
</p>

<h3>3.3. Quad</h3>

<p><a id="wm_018_0023"></a>Four tiles in a 2x2 matrix are known as a <code>quad</code>. Quads are
the primary building blocks for generating Kufic patterns.
</p>
<p>Every possible quad can be represented as a 4-bit number.
The bit order goes left to right, top to down. Bits 1 and 2
on the top row, bits 3 and 4 on the bottom row. Using
hexadecimal, the patterns can be identified as
single-character values 0-f.
</p>
<p>A quad has four sides that are labelled as cardinal
directions north, south, east, west, which correspond to
top, down, right, left. Cardinal directions are used to
address pairs in a quad. For example, the north (n) pair
refers to the top half of the quad, and the east (e) pair
refers to the right side of the quad. Intercardinal
directions are used to address individual tiles in the quad.
For example, the southwest (sw) tile is used to refer to
tile in the bottom lefthand corner (bit position 3), and
the northeast tile (ne) is used to get the top righthand
tile (bit position 2).
</p>

<h3>3.4. Square</h3>

<p><a id="wm_018_0025"></a>Quads then form in a 2x2 configuration to form a <code>square</code>.
Quads are labelled left-to-right top down A, B, C, D. In
addition to these main quads, there are also quads in
between the quads, referred to as AC, AB, CD, BD, and ABCD.
Their label tells which quads they are made out of.
</p>
<p>A square can be represented in C in 2 bytes or a 16-bit
integer. The first byte
holds A (lower nibble) and B (upper nibble). The second byte
holds C (lower nibble) and D (upper nibble).
</p>

<h3>3.5. Block</h3>

<p><a id="wm_018_0027"></a>4 Squares form in a 2x2 configuration to form a <code>block</code>.
