<h2>2. Design Principles</h2>

<p><a id="wm_022_0004"></a>Gest is conceptually grounded around a few musical
axioms, with varying degrees of truthfulness.
</p>
<p>As far as Gest is concerned, Music is...
</p>
<p>...continuous in performance, discrete in instruction.
</p>
<p>When it is written down, music gets turned into notes.
Notes are just that, notes for human musicians to interpret.
Similar to 2d maps of the world, music notation distorts
the music it is trying to represent. Notation systems
could (understandably) leave one to believe that music is
form that can be neatly decomposed into discrete components.
In reality, music is a very continuous
medium. In order to perform music beautifully
(computer or human), one must do so in a fluid manner.
</p>
<p>...rhythmically proportional.
</p>
<p>Rhythms in music are perceived to be proportional to an
underlying implied or explicit pulse (a "beat"). In most
situations, these relationships can be represented in
terms of whole-integer ratios. However, performed rhythms
do not precisely follow these ratios. The amount of imprecision,
and the way rhythms push and pull at these underlying ratios
is what is often referred to as "feel" or "groove".
</p>
<p>...a perceptual subset of speech in music.
</p>
<p>The way we listen to music is cognitively very similar to
the way we listen to speech. Music that is most moving works
because of it's resemblence to that of an emotive voice.
