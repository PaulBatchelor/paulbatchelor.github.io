<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_016_0002"></a>the weewiki crate interface provides some functionality on
top of SQLar, with a slant towards annotating and curating
audio samples (WAV files). Crates provide a bridge from
SQLar to weewiki, and allow files to connect with ecosystem
without having the full files actually be there.
</p>
<p>The crate interface abstracts away files and filenames,
including folder hierarchy structures. This allows for files
to be re-arranged and named in any way that matters. SQLar
and crate will internally preserve the original filenames
and paths.
</p>
<p>Unlike other weewiki operations, every crate operation must
explicitly specify the weewiki database. Weewiki is
typically run from the top-level directory where the
database is. This is rarely the case when using crate.
</p>
<p>Crate works by taking all files in a SQLar database and
importing references of them into the weewiki zettelkasten.
From there, individual samples can be annotated using all
the zet facilities. 
</p>
<p>Every file that gets imported is assigned an item UUID in
the zet, which gets tied to the filepath in the SQLar
database. In addition, a new group is created for that
SQLar archive, and every file path is tied to that group.
Groups in the zet are denoted with an ampersand ('@')
prefix.
</p>
<p>Once in the Zet, file references can be exported to a
TSV file containing metadata. From this metadata, actual
files can be extracted from the SQLar database. Metadata
is intended to be managed inside of source control systems
such as Fossil or Git.
</p>
<p>SQLar archives are copied over into a weewiki database via
a SQLite script. They don't always have to be present. This
saves on disk space. Only use what is currently needed.
