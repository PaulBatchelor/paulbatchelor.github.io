<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_006_0002"></a>Zet is a simple zettelkasten interface implemented in
weewiki.
</p>
<p>Compared to the wiki, zet is more granular. Instead of
hypertext documents connected by links, you have things
connected to things. It is encouraged that information
be more atomic and bite-sized.
</p>
<p>The zet will occupy a new SQLite table called "wikizet".
Like the main wiki, it too will have a key/value schema.
The difference in this case is that keys will not be unique.
This allows one key to point to multiple things.
</p>
<p>A key is expected to be a uuid following the uuid4 specs.
This is generated courtesy of the uuid4 library by rxi. the
values are strings that can mean any number of things based
on the first character:
</p>
<p>a "#" indicates that reference to another uuid. this is how
connections are made.
</p>
<p>a "/" inidicates the start of a file such as /foo/bar.txt.
The intent of this is to use it with sqlar as a way to
reference and link files into weewiki.
</p>
<p>a "!" indicates a reference to a wiki page. This follows
the adopted convention I've been using to reference wiki
pages in my twtxt messages.
</p>
<p>a ">" explicitely indicates a string value.
</p>
<p>values in the zet table optionally include a timestamp
value. This allows the zet to be used as a logging and
microblogging interface along the lines of twtxt.
