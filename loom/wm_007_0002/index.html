<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_007_0002"></a>Orgparse is a portable org-mode parser, written in ANSI C.
It aims to be reasonably fast, and support just enough Org
to do simple document formatting. This includes things
like headers, links, paragraphs, and formatting. Code blocks
are also included to make this suitable for rendering
literate programs written in Org (presumably written in
Org-mode, and tangled using Worgle).
</p>
<p>This document, when tangled, will produce a single header
file called <code>orgparse.h</code>. Defining <code>ORGPARSE_IMPLEMENTATION</code>
will include the code, otherwise it will just be forward
function declarations.
</p>
<p>Notably, this program is used to parse org documents in
the weewiki wiki engine, and is included in the weewiki
codebase.
</p>
<p>Orgparse is primarily designed to export to HTML, but it
uses a callback interface that allows one to make other
backends. An HTML exporting interface has been provided
as a sensible default, and can be used as a good starting
point for how to build a new backend.
</p>
<p>To reduce dependencies and have more granular control, this
parser is hand-coded rather than using a parser tool.
Building a parser this way can be fragile, so a regression
test suite has been included in this program to ensure that
fixed edge cases found don't accidentally end up unfixed
while solving other edge cases.
