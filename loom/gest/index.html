<h1>Gest</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Gest is an implementation of a gesture sequencer,
a tool that sits somewhere in between a classic step
sequencer and an automation curve editor.
</p>

<h2>Gest: The Program</h2>

<p><a href="/loom/gest_program">Gest: The Program</a> is the woven
HTML output of the core implementation, written in ANSI C.
It does not include the sndkit wrapper, LIL bindings, or
the standalone program <code>lilgest</code>. These extra utilities
can be found in the codebase.
</p>

<h2>Gest: The Guide</h2>

<p><a href="/loom/gest_guide">Gest: The Guide</a> provides a
concise guide to understand the concepts behind Gest,
with a set of examples written in LIL and able to be
rendered using <code>lilgest</code>. The guide itself is a literate
program that generates all the example files, as well
as a shell script to render them all.
