<h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Bitlang is a tiny stack-based DSL, implemented in ANSI-C,
designed for the sole purpose of producing procedurally
generated 1-bit art. The goal was to build a system that
could efficiently be used in the context of video and
animation for projects of mine like the Candy Crystal
Rainbow Codex.
