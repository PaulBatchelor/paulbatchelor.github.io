<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_019_0002"></a>What is bugz?
</p>
<p>Well, this is my mostly naive attempt at a granular delay
system. Well, an idea for now.
</p>
<p>Here is how I think it will work:
</p>
<p>Bugz will take in one input signal.
</p>
<p>At any given time, this input signal will fill the buffer of
a "bug" (assuming if a bug is available).
</p>
<p>When bug is done being filled, it will make itself active.
</p>
<p>An active bug will "fire".
When fired, Bug will take its local buffer, and apply a
windowing envelope. Probably a hanning window. It will also
apply an amplitude (factored in by the decay level).
</p>
<p>When the bug is done being fired, the inner amplitude will
decay a bit, and it will wait to fire again.
</p>
<p>The bug will continue firing until the decay is
(more or less) zero.
</p>
<p>The hope is that multiple bugs firing at once will create a
satisfying granular cloud texture.
</p>
<p>Firing bugs will divide themselves up among four channels,
where they can be procssed individually
(or summed together).
