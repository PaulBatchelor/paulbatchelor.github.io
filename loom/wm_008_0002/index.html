<h3>1. What is Worgle?</h3>

<p><a id="wm_008_0002"></a>Hello, fellow human. I'm glad you could stop by.
This is a document written in Org markup, talking about a
thing I'm building called Worgle.
</p>

<h4>1.1. The name "Worgle"</h4>

<p><a id="wm_008_0004"></a>The name <b>Worgle</b> is
derived from what it is: a Worg Tangler. <code>Worg</code> is the name
of this project. The word "Worg" is a mix of WEB + ORG, two
systems used for literate programming.
Org is the very decent markup language from org-mode.
WEB is
the name of the first literate programming tool ever created
by Donald Knuth. In literate programming,
one writes language and code together in a markup language,
which can then be parsed two ways. The <b>weaver</b> parses
the markup to produce a human readable document, usually a
(La)TeX or HTML file. The <b>tangler</b> parses the markup and
produces computer code that can be read by a computer to run
or compile the program.
</p>
<p>In other words, Worgle is a literate programming tangler
used to convert org-like markup into (primarily) code.
</p>

<h4>1.2. Bootstrapping</h4>

<p><a id="wm_008_0006"></a>Worgle itself is a literate program, so what tangles the
worgle code? Orgle does! Orgle is a program written in
ANSI C (without literate programming).
It is designed to be just enough of a program to tangle this
file into a slightly better program called Worglite.
Worglite then tangles this file <b>again</b> to build to full
Worgle program.
</p>
<p>Worgle initially started out as a literate program rewrite
of Orgle. In fact, this write-up initially started out as an
outline for the Orgle program!
</p>
<p>Following me so far? No? Yes? Great, let's get started.
