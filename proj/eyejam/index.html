<h1>EyeJam</h1>
<p><img src="/res/eyejam/launcher.png" alt="EyeJam" /></p>
<p>Eyejam is an open-source eye-controlled music composition environment.
This was developed 
during for my summer internship with the Enable Group at Microsoft Research. 
The source code can be found on 
<a href="https://www.github.com/MSRenable/HandsFreeSoundJam">github</a> under the official
project name <strong>Microsoft Hands-Free Sound Jam</strong>. </p>
<p>EyeJam is cross-platform, with suport for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Eye-control
is only available on Windows. On the other platforms, eye control is simulated
using the mouse cursor. </p>
<p>EyeJam uses a set of cross-platform libaries that 
<a href="/proj">I've used on previous projects</a>. </p>
<p>These libraries include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/proj/soundpipe.html">Soundpipe</a> for sound synthesis and DSP</li>
<li><a href="https://www.github.com/thestk/RtAudio">RtAudio</a> for cross-platform realtime 
audio</li>
<li><a href="https://www.github.com/memononen/NanoVG">NanoVG</a> for graphics via GLFW</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for saving/loading capabilites</li>
</ul>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>The core motivation for building Eyejam was to design a novel musical interface
for musicians with 
<a href="
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a>, more commonly 
refered to as ALS. 
People with ALS slowly lose their ability to voluntarily control their muscles.
One of the last things they are able to control is their eyes. For this reason,
eye tracking has been a very popular means for communication and interaction
in the ALS community. </p>
<p>EyeJam is a live performance and music composition environment which revolves
around eye-control.
It uses hardware made by <a href="https://www.tobii.com/">Tobii</a>
for eyetracking. The core means of interaction
is known as <em>dwelling</em>, which involves looking at a particular UI elements such
as buttons for a period of time to simulate a mouse click event.</p>
<p>The design of EyeJam is highly inspired by paradigms established in 
commercial digital audio workstations. EyeJam implements a programmable 
clip launcher based off of the one found in Ableton Live.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Documentation for EyeJam can be found in the <a href="
https://github.com/MSREnable/HandsFreeSoundJam/blob/master/usage.md">documentation included in 
the source code</a></p>
<h2>Video Demos</h2>
<p>The following videos below contain video walkthroughs for how to 
compose with EyeJam using the built-in clip step editor. </p>
