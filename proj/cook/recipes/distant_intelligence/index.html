<h1>Distant Intelligence</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/distant_intelligence.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>This is a sporthling I made with the intention of being used inside of
the Sporth editor in AudioKit. For this reason, the patch has four 
external controls, represented as the first 4 p-registers. They are
as follows:
<ul>
<li>Control 1: Pitch</li>
<li>Control 2: Tempo</li>
<li>Control 3: FM Brightness</li>
<li>Control 4: FM Detune</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Table generation</h2>
<p>First begin by generating a sequence called <em>seq</em>. 
These are the midi note numbers of the scale used.</p>
<pre><code> _seq '67 69 71 72 74 76' gen_vals</code></pre>
<p>P-registers are being used by an external program, so we create an argument
table called "args". </p>
<pre><code> _args 4 zeros</code></pre>
<p>P-register 4 is not being used, so this is set to be the frequency of 
the C above middle C (midi note 72).
This will be used as the base frequency for "gen\_padsynth". </p>
<pre><code> 72 mtof 4 pset</code></pre>
<p>This table generated contains the amplitudes for partials, need for padsynth.</p>
<pre><code> _amps '1.0 0.5 0.25 0.5' gen_vals</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the padsynth wavetable is generated. </p>
<pre><code> _pad 262144 4 p 40 'amps' gen_padsynth</code></pre>
<h2>Clock</h2>
<p>The clock of the patch is set with a dmetro, whose value is set by 
p-register 1. It is scaled to be 40 to 200 BPM, then multiplied 
by four to represent sixteenth notes. This value is converted to
a duration before being sent to dmetro.</p>
<pre><code> 1 p 40 200 scale 4 * bpm2dur dmetro</code></pre>
<p>This steady dmetro clock is sent into a maytrig, where a trigger has a 
60 percent chance of reaching the other side of the maytrig. It is duplicated
and set to the first value of table <em>args</em>. </p>
<pre><code> 0.6 maytrig dup 0 _args tset</code></pre>
<h2>FM </h2>
<p>This patch contains a single FM oscillator. 
The exponential envelope created has a 2ms attack, 4ms hold, and a 200ms
release time. The trigger for it is from the maygated dmetro, currently
on the stack.  This pushes an envelope onto the stack. Remember this...</p>
<pre><code> 0.002 0.004 0.2 tenvx</code></pre>
<p>Now comes paramters for the FM oscillator itself, starting with frequency.
p-register zero ultimately picks the frequency that the oscillator should
play. It picks one of 4 values, which is sent to <em>tget</em>. The values are 
floored to truncate any fractional components. </p>
<pre><code> 0 p 0 4 scale floor _seq tget</code></pre>
<p>Some portamento is added to gliss between the selected notes.</p>
<pre><code> 0.1 port</code></pre>
<p>Now the midi note values get converted to frequencies...</p>
<pre><code> mtof </code></pre>
<p>We save this frequency to index 2 of the <em>args</em> table to be used later on. </p>
<pre><code> dup 2 _args tset </code></pre>
<p>The amplitude of the FM oscillator is 0.2
The carrier ratio is 1.</p>
<pre><code> 0.2 1</code></pre>
<p>Onto the modulator ratio now. 
The clock signal is taken from index 0 of the table <em>args</em>, and this feeds
into <em>trand</em>, producing floating point values between 0 and 5. We then
duplicate this value and truncate the fractional part with floor. We then
use p-register 3 to crossfade between the values. </p>
<pre><code> 0 _args tget 0 5 trand dup floor 3 p cf</code></pre>
<p>An integer modulator value will create harmonic partials, while a fraction
value will create a more clangorous sound. The crossfade controls the amount
of "bite" it will have.</p>
<p>Finally, p-register 2 controls the modulation index, which essentially 
determines the brightness. The control signal is put through a portamento
filter with a very long time, so only gradual changes are possible.</p>
<p>After this, the FM oscillator is multiplied with the exponetial envelope.</p>
<pre><code> 2 p 0.5 port 0 3 scale
 fm *</code></pre>
<h2>Padsynth </h2>
<p>There are two wavetable oscillators which utilize the Padsynth algorithm
by Nasca Octavian Paul. </p>
<p>Due to the nature of the wavetable, the frequency portion of the 
oscillator needs special treatment. An oscillator of 1 Hz has frequency
of C above middle C (midi number 72), so any other frequency must be
relative to that (2 Hz, for instance, would be an octave higher, 0.5 hz 
an octave lower). </p>
<p>The frequency of the FM oscillator from before is extracted from index 2
of the table called <em>args</em>, and is divided by the base frequency set to 
p register 4. This gives us our relative frequency. </p>
<pre><code> 2 _args tget 4 p / </code></pre>
<p>The rest of the arguments are pretty typical parameters to oscillator: 
amplitude, phase, and table name. The oscillator is added with the FM 
oscillator.</p>
<pre><code> 0.1 0 _pad osc +</code></pre>
<p>The process is repeated again for our second oscillator, 
only we give it a frequency 1.5 times that of the FM oscillator, giving us
a perfect fifth above. This oscillator is then added into the mix.</p>
<pre><code> 2 _args tget 1.5 * 4 p / 0.1 0 _pad osc +</code></pre>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>The only effect use here is a reverb. This reverb algorithm is the 
zitareverb algorithm. The unit generator here is a simplified version
of the reverb generator with less parameters. </p>
<pre><code> dup dup 5 8 3000 zrev drop 0.3 * +
