<h1>Chatting Robot</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/chatting_robot.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>"Chatting Robot", also known as "computer talking on the phone with his 
Mother", is a patch centered around a rudimentary vowel synthesis 
technique. This technique involves an approximate glottal excitation 
signal sent through three bandpass filters tuned at specific formant
frequencies.
<h2>Table generation</h2>
<p>The tables are used to store parameters for the three bandpass filters. 
Tables are used to interpolate between three different states, each corresponding
to a different vowel sound:</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>position 0 is an 'o' sound</li>
<li>position 1 is an 'a' sound</li>
<li>position 2 is an 'e' sound</li>
</ul>
<p>The interpolation between the states allows the voice to smoothly morph 
between vowels.</p>
<p>Tables <em>f1</em>, <em>f2</em>, and <em>f3</em> correspond to the first, second, and third
bandfilters, respectively.</p>
<pre><code> # o a e
 'f1' '350 600 400' gen_vals
 'f2' '600 1040 1620' gen_vals
 'f3' '2400 2250 2400' gen_vals</code></pre>
<p>Tables <em>g1</em>, <em>g2</em>, and <em>g3</em> correspond to the gains of the bandpass filters.</p>
<pre><code> 'g1' '1 1 1' gen_vals
 'g2' '0.28184 0.4468 0.251' gen_vals
 'g3' '0.0891 0.354 0.354' gen_vals</code></pre>
<p>Tables <em>bw1</em>, <em>bw2</em>, and <em>bw3</em> correspond to the bandwidths of the bandpass
filters.</p>
<pre><code> 'bw1' '40 60 40' gen_vals
 'bw2' '80 70 80' gen_vals
 'bw3' '100 110 100' gen_vals</code></pre>
<h2>Jitter</h2>
<p>The jitter signal is in charge of morphing between the vowel sounds. The 
core of the jitter signal is <strong>randi</strong>, who range and between 0 and 2, 
and whose speed is modulated by a sine wave between 2 and 10. </p>
<p>The output signal is then copied to p-register 0. </p>
<pre><code> 0 2
 0.1 1 sine 2 10 biscale
 randi 0 pset</code></pre>
<h2>Glottis </h2>
<p>To simulate the glottis, a bandlimited pulse oscillator is used with a 
now pulse width, or duty cycle. </p>
<p>The frequency of the glottis is randomly modulated with another <strong>randi</strong>
jitter signal in the range of 110 and 200 Hz. The rate of change is modulated 
with a sine wave in the range of 2 and 8 Hz. </p>
<pre><code> 110 200 0.8 1 sine 2 8 biscale randi </code></pre>
<p>Additional deviation is added using jitter.</p>
<pre><code> 3 20 30 jitter + </code></pre>
<p>Finally, the rest of <em>square</em>, with an amplitude of 0.2 and a pulse width of
0.1.</p>
<pre><code> 0.2 0.1 square
 dup</code></pre>
<h2>Resonant Cavities</h2>
<p>The glottal signal is fed through three bandpass filters in series to generate
vowel sounds. </p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, parameters are linearly interpolated 
between three states in order to morph between vowel sounds. The 
interpolation is done using <em>tabread</em>. </p>
<pre><code> 0 p 0 0 0 'g1' tabread *
 0 p 0 0 0 'f1' tabread
 0 p 0 0 0 'bw1' tabread
 butbp</code></pre>
<p>and here are the other two filters...</p>
<pre><code> swap dup
 0 p 0 0 0 'g2' tabread *
 0 p 0 0 0 'f2' tabread
 0 p 0 0 0 'bw2' tabread
 butbp
 swap
 0 p 0 0 0 'g3' tabread *
 0 p 0 0 0 'f3' tabread
 0 p 0 0 0 'bw3' tabread
 butbp
 + +</code></pre>
<h2>Words</h2>
<p>The signal generated up to this point is pretty good, but it is a 
endless babble with no breaks.
It would be good to add some pockets of silence to add space and create
words and phrases.
This effecting is created using a makeshifte envelope generator, built
from a maygate and a portamento filter. The maygate is being fed by 
a dmetro, sending off a tick every 400 milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code> 0.4 dmetro 0.5 maygate 0.01 port * 2.0 *</code></pre>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Finally, the resulting signal is sent into <strong>zitareverb</strong>. </p>
<pre><code> dup
 60 500 3.0 1.0 6000
 315 6
 2000 0
 0.2 2 zitarev drop
