<h1>Oatmeal</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/oatmeal.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>This was a quick patch I whipped up some morning while eating some oatmeal.
It is part of my ongoing collection of <a href="/sporthlings/002">sporthlings</a>.
By and large, this patch was derived by layering simple sounds together.
<h2>Tables and Variables</h2>
<p>Tables generation is minimal. A sine lookup table is generated for some oscillators,
A single variable <em>d</em> is used for the dust signal.</p>
</p>
<pre><code> _wav 8192 gen_sine
 _d var</code></pre>
<h2>Dust</h2>
<p>The <strong>dust</strong> ugen is a ugen that fires random impulses at a certain
density. It is unique in that it works well as both a control signal as 
well as an audio signal. This patch uses this signal for both purposes.</p>
<p>The first argument to <strong>dust</strong> is amplitude, which is set to a constant 2.</p>
<pre><code> 2 </code></pre>
<p>The second argument is density, which is controlled by a low-frequency 
oscillator, set at 0.2 Hz. It is scaled via <strong>biscale</strong> to go between
5 and 20 impulses per second. </p>
<pre><code> 0.2 1 0 _wav osc 5 20 biscale</code></pre>
<p>The rest of <strong>dust</strong> is written out. The final argument to <strong>dust</strong> is
the mode, which has been set to 1, bipolar mode.
The signal is duplicated, and one of the values is set to teh variable <em>d</em>.</p>
<pre><code> 1 dust dup _d set</code></pre>
<p>The dust signal continues onward, being filtered by <strong>wpkorg35</strong>. It is set
to a cutoff frequency of 1100 with a very high resonance (this particular
filter has a range of 0-2, and the resonance is 1.9. The sonic output
of putting impulses into a highly resonant filter little sinusoidal blip 
sounds. One of my favorite go-to effects. </p>
<pre><code> 1100 1.9 0 wpkorg35</code></pre>
<p>To add some body, the blips are fed into the chowning reverb, which I have
found to be very favorable to sinusoidal signals for some reason.</p>
<pre><code> jcrev </code></pre>
<h2>Blerps</h2>
<p>The next layer in our cake of sound are what I will call "blerps". These
are rhythmic blips tuned at whole integer ratios from one another. </p>
<p>The make up of a single "blerp" consists of a sinusoid and an envelope.
The envelope is created gate signal (generated via <strong>tgate</strong>)
being sent through a portamento filter. The gate is controlled via the
dust signal stored in variable <em>d</em>. To make things less busy, the trigger
is fed into a maytrig.</p>
<pre><code> _d get 0.5 maytrig 0.01 tgate 0.001 port </code></pre>
<p>The envelope generatored is then multipled with a sinusoidal oscillator 
tuned at 1000Hz. This signal is then added onto the current signal.</p>
<pre><code> 1000 0.3 0 _wav osc *  + </code></pre>
<p>The same thing more or less is repeated 2 more times, with a few variations
in parameters. The oscillators are tuned to 2000Hz and 500Hz.</p>
<pre><code> _d get 0.5 maytrig 0.004 tgate 0.001 port 
 2000 0.3 0 _wav osc *  + 
 _d get 0.2 maytrig 0.004 tgate 0.001 port 
 500 0.3 0 _wav osc *  + </code></pre>
<h2>Noise</h2>
<p><strong>Randh</strong>, like dust, can function equally well as a control signal and an
audio signal. When the rate is set to audio-rate frequencies, you can get
different "colors" of noise, an sound reminiscent to 8-bit game sounds.</p>
<p>For starters, an envelope signal is generated in similar manner to the 
envelopes created in the previous section.</p>
<pre><code> _d get 0.3 maytrig 0.04 tgate 0.005 port </code></pre>
<p>The arguments for ugen <strong>randh</strong> can now begin. These two arguments tell
randh to produce random values between (+/-)0.05. </p>
<pre><code> -0.05 0.05 </code></pre>
<p>The third argument to <strong>randh</strong> is rate (or frequency), which we have
delegated to a triggerable random number generator <strong>trand</strong>. The 
trigger signal is being fed by our dust signal, and is producing random
values between 1102Hz and 11025Hz. </p>
<pre><code> _d get 1102 11025 trand  </code></pre>
<p>Finally, <strong>randh</strong> is called and multiplied with the corresponding 
envelope. It is then added to the current signal. </p>
<pre><code> randh * + </code></pre>
<h2>Processing</h2>
<p>The effects processing is used in a very unusual way. One could argue that
the processing is an instrument as well.</p>
<p>To begin, the signal is duplicated so that a dry version of the signal
is stored.</p>
<pre><code> dup </code></pre>
<p>The first thing created is a "throw" signal. The dust signal used from 
before feeds into a very sparse <strong>maytrig</strong>. This trigger signal feeds
into a tenv, where a very gentle envelope signal is multipled with
the signal to be processed. The results is we are occasionally "throwing"
the signal into processor. This term is borrowed from what is known by
mix engineers as a "reverb throw". </p>
<pre><code> _d get 0.1 maytrig 0.4 0.1 0.1 tenv * </code></pre>
<p>The thrown signal is fed into a feedback delay of 300ms with a feedback 
amount of 60 percent.</p>
<pre><code> 0.6 0.3 delay </code></pre>
<p>The feedback delay is fed into the pitch shifter <strong>pshift</strong>, where it is
tuned up an octave.</p>
<pre><code> 12 1024 512 pshift </code></pre>
<p>The pitch shifted signal is put through a butterworth lowpass, and then 
attenuated by 6dB. The dry and wet signal are then added together.</p>
<pre><code> 1000 butlp -6 ampdb * + 

</code></pre>
