<h1>In Seven</h1>

<p>The sporthling <em>in seven</em> is a recreation of an earlier csound live coding
patch that I wrote. It can be summarized as being a sequenced FM synth
with careful use of C:M ratio modulation and reverb throws. 
<h2>Tables and Variables</h2>
<p>To begin, a number of tables and variables are created:
<ul>
<li>The table <em>seq</em> is used to store a sequence of note values to step 
through</li>
<li>The variable <em>clk</em> is used to store clock signals. </li>
<li>The variable <em>send</em> is used to store a signal to be sent to the reverb
effect. In this patch, the amount of signal sent to reverb is modulated
through a pulsed envelope, creating what is known as a "reverb throw".</li>
<li>The variable <em>dry</em> contains a copy of the dry signal.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</p>
<pre><code> _seq &quot;0 4 5 7 -2&quot; gen_vals
 _clk var 
 _dry var 
 _send var </code></pre>
<h2>Prop Clock</h2>
<p>The main clock signal used in this patch is generated via <em>prop</em>, a 
micro-language for generating rhythms based on proportions. A full
explanation of prop is beyond the scope of this document, but more 
information can be found <a href="/proj/prop.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main gist of what is happening is that "prop" is generating a 
7/8 rhythm with a 223 subdivision. The tempo is set to 210 BPM. T</p>
<p>This signal is saved to the variable <em>clk</em>. </p>
<pre><code> 210 &quot;++2(+-+)&quot; prop _clk set</code></pre>
<h2>FM patch</h2>
<p>The crux of this patch is driven by FM oscillator. The parameters of
an FM oscillator are ampltiude, frequency, C:M ratio, and a modulation
index. Each of these parameters are carefully modulated to produce
the range of timbres that you hear. 
<h3>Frequency and Amplitude</h3>
<p>The frequency is being modulated via <em>tseq</em>, a trigger sequencer. The
clock generated by <em>prop</em> feeds this signal and causes it to cycle through
the table <em>seq</em> in time. The sequence is then biased by 58 to put it 
in the key of B flat, then converted to frequency with <em>mtof</em>. To prevent
clicks, a small portamento filter is added. </p>
</p>
<pre><code> _clk get 0 _seq tseq 58 + mtof 0.001 port </code></pre>
<p>The amplitude of this parameter is fixed, and is set to 0.3.</p>
<pre><code> 0.3</code></pre>
<h3>Carrier</h3>
<p>The <em>carrier</em> component is part of the C:M ratio. It is typically a 
positive integer value denoting the frequency of the "carrier" oscillator,
which is the oscillator that you actually hear. </p>
<p>The clock signal in the variable <em>clk</em> is being used with the triggerable 
random number generator <strong>trand</strong> to produce a value between 1 and 3. 
This value is converted to a whole number integer via <strong>floor</strong>. It is
important to keep this value as a whole number to prevent 
clangorous non-harmonic timbres. When the Carrier component is anything
but 1, it makes the frequency appear to jump to Carrier * frequency. </p>
<pre><code> _clk get 1 3 trand floor </code></pre>
<h3>Modulator</h3>
<p>The <em>modulator</em> component is the second part of the C:M ratio. This 
component determines the frequency of the modulator oscillator, which
modulates the frequency of the carrier oscillator. Larger values will 
cause harmonics to be more sparsely spread out, and often will sound
brighter. </p>
<p>Similar to the carrier signal, it is being modulated via <strong>trand</strong>, this
time using values between 1 and 7. The signal is also being floored to
keep timbres "tonal". </p>
<pre><code> _clk get 1 7 trand floor</code></pre>
<h3>Modulation Index</h3>
<p>The modulatation index determines how much frequency modulation happens.
A modulation index of 0 creates a sinusoidal tone. The modulation index
can be crudely thought of as a brightness control or something analogous
to filter cutoff in a subtractive synthesis patch. </p>
<p>The modulation index is controlled by a low-frequency sinusoidal oscillator
moving at a period of 30 seconds, moving between 0.1 and 2 via <strong>biscale</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 30 inv 1 sine 0.1 2 biscale</code></pre>
<p>This being the last argument, it is closed with the actual "fm" word.</p>
<pre><code> fm </code></pre>
<h2>Reverb Throw</h2>
<p>To add excitement, some of the signal is occasionally thrown into a
reverb in what as known as a reverb throw. In analogue days, this was
done using a fader sporadically moved up from time to time. </p>
<p>To begin, a copy of the FM sound is created via <strong>dup</strong>. One of these 
signals will signal sent to the reverb. </p>
<pre><code> dup </code></pre>
<p>To simulate the sporadically on fader, the clock signal <em>clk</em> is fed into a 
<strong>maygate</strong>.  When triggered, maygate will have a 20% probability of 
turning on. This allows tempo-synced throws to occur.</p>
<pre><code> _clk get 0.2 maygate </code></pre>
<p>The maygate signal is either on or off, which can cause very sharp
jumps. To smooth this out, a portamento filter is used. </p>
<pre><code> 0.01 port </code></pre>
<p>This signal is then multiplied with one of the copies of FM signal, and
stored into the variable <em>send</em>. </p>
<pre><code> * _send set</code></pre>
<h2>Envelopes for articulation</h2>
<p>Right now, the FM signal is constantly "on"; there is no sense of 
articulation (authors note: the throw signal has no articulation. This
was by accident, by it will be left in). To create articulation, an
envelope signal is created via <strong>tenv</strong>. It is clocked by the global
clock <em>clk</em>. The signal is then multiplied with the dry signal.</p>
<pre><code> _clk get 0.001 0.01 0.4 tenv *</code></pre>
<p>This completes the dry signal, so it is set to the variable <em>dry</em>. </p>
<pre><code> _dry set</code></pre>
<h2>Effect Processing</h2>
<h3>Reverb</h3>
<p>For reverb, <strong>revsc</strong> is used. The input signal of the reverb module is
a combination of the dry signal and the send signal boosted by a factor
of 2. Since this reverb is stereo, it is duplicated. </p>
<pre><code> _dry get _send get 2 * + dup </code></pre>
<p>The reverb parameters are set to have a 0.97 decay rate (1.0 being an 
infinite hold reverb) with a 5000Hz cutoff. </p>
<pre><code> 0.97 5000 revsc </code></pre>
<p>Since <strong>revsc</strong> is a stereo signal, one of the values is <strong>drop</strong>ed. 
The remaining signal is attenuated by 27 dB, making it only really audible 
when dry signal is "thrown" into it. </p>
<pre><code> drop -27 ampdb * </code></pre>
<p>ReverbSC causes a lot of DC offset, so a dc blocker filter <strong>dcblk</strong> is
used.</p>
<pre><code> dcblk</code></pre>
<h3>Feedback Delay</h3>
<p>In addition to reverb, a tempo-synced delay line is also processed with
the signal in parallel.</p>
<p>The input signal is only the throw signal from the variable <em>send</em>. </p>
<pre><code> _send get </code></pre>
<p>The feedback parameter is set to 0.8, or 80 percent loss.</p>
<pre><code> 0.8 </code></pre>
<p>The delay time is set to be a dotted quarter note delay time. This is
done by converting the BPM (210) to a duration, then multiplying that
by 1.5. </p>
<pre><code> 210 bpm2dur 1.5 * </code></pre>
<p>The output of the delay signal is sent into a butter lowpass filter
<strong>butlp</strong> with a cutoff of 800Hz. This is done so it does not interfere
with the spectrum of the dry signal. After that, it is attenuated by
7 dB. </p>
<pre><code> delay 800 butlp -7 ampdb * + </code></pre>
<p>The dry signal is added back in, thus completing the patch.</p>
<pre><code> _dry get + 

</code></pre>
