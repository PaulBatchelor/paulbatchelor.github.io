<h1>Play With Toys</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/play_with_toys.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>Play with toys is a fun little patch making use of sequencing and
weighted random distributions. 
<h2>Tables and Variables</h2>
<p>The only table used in this patch is called <em>seq</em>, used as the main 
sequencer. The table is generated using <em>gen_rand</em>, which generates
a weighted distribution for randomness. </p>
</p>
<pre><code> _seq 32 &quot;0 0.4 7 0.4 12 0.1 5 0.1&quot; gen_rand</code></pre>
<p>The patch uses a number of variables through out the patch:
<ul>
<li>the clock signal is stored in <em>clk</em></li>
<li>the main trigger signal is stored in <em>trig</em></li>
<li>the frequency (MIDI note number) of the sequence is stored in <em>freq</em></li>
<li>the entire dry signal is stored in <em>dry</em></li>
<li>the bpm (set to 110) is stored in <em>bpm</em></li>
</ul>
</p>
<pre><code> _clk var 
 _trig var
 _freq var
 _dry var
 _bpm 110 varset</code></pre>
<h2>Clocks, Triggers, and Sequencing</h2>
<p>After the variables and tables have been declared, it is time to set
up the main sequencer. Like many patches, this starts with a clock signal.
This is done using <strong>clock</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 0 _bpm get 4 clock _clk set</code></pre>
<p>From the clock signal, a trigger signal is derived by feeding it through
<strong>maygate</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> _clk get 0.6 maytrig _trig set</code></pre>
<p>Next, the trigger signal drives <strong>tseq</strong>. <strong>tseq</strong> is set to shuffle mode,
randomly sequencing through the distribution in <em>seq</em>. It is then
biased by 60 (middle C) and assigned to <em>freq</em>.</p>
<pre><code> _trig get 1 _seq tseq 60 + _freq set</code></pre>
<h2>FM Oscillator</h2>
<p>The crux of this patch comes from the FM oscillator described below. 
Here, the frequency is obtained from <em>freq</em> and converted from MIDI
to frequency using <strong>mtof</strong>. The next argument, amplitude, is set to 0.1.</p>
<pre><code> _freq get mtof 0.1 </code></pre>
<p>The trigger signal <em>trig</em> is used to randomly modulate the C:M ratio 
of the FM pair via <em>trand</em>. To keep the spectra harmonically related
to the fundamental and not clangorous, it is important to ensure that
the C:M ratio uses whole integers, so the output of <strong>trand</strong> is 
floored using <strong>floor</strong>. </p>
<pre><code> _trig get 0 3 trand floor
 _trig get 0 7 trand  floor</code></pre>
<p>A static modulation index of 1 is used, which completes the arguments for
<strong>fm</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 1 fm</code></pre>
<p>The amplitude envelope of the FM oscillator is generated via <strong>tenvx</strong>.
The trigger signal <em>trig</em> used above also feeds into <strong>tenvx</strong>. The FM
and envelope signals are then multiplied together.</p>
<pre><code> _trig get 0.005 0.01 0.04 tenvx * </code></pre>
<h2>Moog Saw</h2>
<p>Acting as a bassline, a subtractive saw oscillator uses a bandlimited 
sawtooth oscillator fed through a moog filter. The frequency used
is identical to the frequency used in the FM oscillator, but pitched
down an octave to exist in the bass register. </p>
<pre><code> _freq get 12 - mtof 0.1 saw 1000 0.1 moogladder</code></pre>
<p>The envelope generator in the bass patch also uses the same <em>trig</em> trigger 
signal, except that it is fed into a maytrig to make it more sparse and 
less overwhelming in the mix.</p>
<pre><code> _trig get 0.3 maytrig 0.01 0.01 0.1 tenvx * </code></pre>
<p>The bass patch is then mixed into everything else so far, and assigned to
the variable <em>dry</em>. </p>
<pre><code> + _dry set</code></pre>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>For effects processing, the dry signal <em>dry</em> is fed into the zita reverb
module <strong>zrev</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> _dry get dup 10 10 10000 zrev drop -10 ampdb * </code></pre>
<p>To keep the mix from getting too muddy, the reverb is highpassed at 1000kHZ,
leaving plenty of space for the bass instrument.</p>
<pre><code> 1000 buthp </code></pre>
<p>This signal is then added back into the dry mix. </p>
<pre><code> _dry get +</code></pre>
