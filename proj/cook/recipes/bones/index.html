<h1>Bones</h1>

<pre><code> # Bones
 # By Paul Batchelor
 # September 2016</code></pre>
<p>Bones is a quick sporthlet I made to get back into the habbit of
making sporthlets. It primarily utilizes modal synthesize and variable
feedback delay lines to achieve something vaguely bone like (well, 
at one point it was).</p>
<h2>Tables and variables</h2>
<p>The first table created is a set of modal ratios approximating a 
uniform wooden bar ratios. They have been obtained from
http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/MiscModalFreq.html.</p>
<pre><code> _rat &quot;1 2.5752 4.4644 6.984&quot; gen_vals</code></pre>
<p>Variables are a relatively new concept in Sporth, and have their own
commands for setting and getting. <em>tk</em> is a variable that will hold
the trigger tick, and <em>frq</em> will eventually hold the fundamental
frequency of the instrument.</p>
<pre><code> _tk var
 _frq var</code></pre>
<h2>Trigger generation</h2>
<p>The base trigger is a metronome, whose rate is randomized via
a <strong>randh</strong> module.</p>
<pre><code> 1 10 1 randh metro</code></pre>
<p>A consistent metronome can annoying quickly, so it is sent through
a maytrig to hush it up every now and then. The probability randomly
swings between 0.1 and 0.8 via <strong>randi</strong>. To make the line a little less
regular, the rate gets changed with <strong>randh</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> (0.1 0.8 (1 10 3 randh) randi) maytrig </code></pre>
<p>The maytrig reduces the density, but phrasing is also important. 
for this reason, the output of the maytrig is multiplied by a <strong>maygate</strong>.
(Could this have been done with just one maytrig? Probably. But that
I did not think of this in the moment of creating this)</p>
<pre><code> dup 0.65 maygate * </code></pre>
<p><strong>tick</strong> is added onto the trigger signal, to ensure that there is a 
trigger at the start of the sporth drawing. </p>
<pre><code> tick + </code></pre>
<p>The entire signal is assigned to the variable <em>tk</em> via the <strong>set</strong> ugen.</p>
<pre><code> _tk set</code></pre>
<h2>Modal Resonators</h2>
<p>An entire explanation of modal resonators and modal synthesis are 
beyond the scope of this sporthlet, but a small one will be given.
One can think of a modal filter as a filter that resonants at a particular 
Q and frequency. In modal synthesis, an excitation signal (in this case, 
a trigger signal), is fed through a bank of modal filters, configured
in both series and in parallel. What comes out is the sound. This technique
is largely used in physical modelling. </p>
<p>The base frequency of the instrument is set via <strong>trand</strong>, who trigger
is obtained from the previously set variable <em>tk</em>.</p>
<pre><code> _tk get 500 1500 trand _frq set</code></pre>
<p>The trigger signal <em>tk</em> is sent through two modal filters in series, whose
frequences are obtained from the first two elements table <em>rat</em>, multiplied
by the frequency <em>frq</em>. In the first modal filter, the Q is being randomized
via <strong>randi</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> _tk get (_frq get 0 _rat tget *) 10 40 3 randi mode
 (_frq get 1 _rat tget *) 20 mode</code></pre>
<p>The process is repeated again, this time with the last two modal 
frequency ratios in <em>rat</em>, and different Q values (by the way, these
Q values were chosen fairly randomly with a little experimentation)</p>
<pre><code> _tk get (_frq get 2 _rat tget *) 22 mode
 (_frq get 3 _rat tget *) 15 mode +</code></pre>
<h2>Delay lines</h2>
<p>The variable delay line is the crucial element that adds a strange crittery
characteristic to the sound. This is done by randomizing the feedback
and delay times with <strong>randi</strong>. </p>
<pre><code> dup 0.1 0.8 3 randi
 0.001 0.2 (0.1 4 1 randi) randi
 1.0 vdelay</code></pre>
<p>To add more texture to the delay line, a <strong>smoothdelay</strong> is applied
to the variable delay signal. A smooth delay line is like a variable
delay line, except there is no residual pitch modulation. <strong>Randi</strong> is used
to control feedback, and <strong>sine</strong> is used to control delay time. 
To add space and variation, the level is modulated by yet another 
<strong>randi</strong>. </p>
<pre><code> dup 0.4 0.9 0.5 randi
 0.2 1 sine 0.01 0.3 biscale
 1.0 64 smoothdelay 0 1 0.2 randi *</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the delay lines and dry signal are summed together.</p>
<pre><code> + +</code></pre>
<h2>Post-effects</h2>
<p>The final effects used are a gentle chowning reverb fed through
a hard limiter <strong>limit</strong>. </p>
<pre><code> dup jcrev -6 ampdb * + -1 1 limit</code></pre>
