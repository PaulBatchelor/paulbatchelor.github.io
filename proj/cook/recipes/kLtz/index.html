<h1>kLtz</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/kltz.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>kLtz is a patch I wrote for Aure demonstrating one way I use
<strong>smoothdelay</strong>, a variable delay line that does not have pitch modulation.
The name is inspired by titles from artists like Aphex Twin and Autechre.
After creating the initial patch, I then added control sliders, which 
ended up adding a lot of dimension.</p>
<p>The controls of the patch are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control 1: tempo</li>
<li>Control 2: probability</li>
<li>Control 3: feedback</li>
<li>Control 4: resonance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clock</h2>
<p>As usual, the patch starts off with setting up the clock. </p>
<p>First, a 1-size ftable called <em>trig</em> is created for storing the 
clock signal. </p>
<pre><code> _trig 1 zeros</code></pre>
<p><strong>dmetro</strong> is the main clock source. The BPM is decided from p-register
0, and multiplied by 4 to make the clock sixteenth notes. <strong>bpm2dur</strong>
converts the bpm to a duration in seconds to make it a suitable 
parameter for <strong>dmetro</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 0 p 60 155 scale 4 * bpm2dur dmetro</code></pre>
<p>The output of <strong>dmetro</strong> is fed into a maytrig, whose probability is
controlled by p-register 1.</p>
<pre><code> 1 p 0.2 1 scale maytrig </code></pre>
<p>From there, the signal is set to the table <em>trig</em> via <strong>tset</strong>. 
Prior to that it is
duplicated so that the clock signal also remains on the stack.</p>
<pre><code> dup 0 _trig tset </code></pre>
<h2>Envelope</h2>
<p>The clock signal generated from the previous section triggers an 
exponential envelope. The attack and hold parameters are constants. </p>
<pre><code> 0.0001 0.004</code></pre>
<p>The final parameter is the release time.
The release time is randomly generated with the sample and hold generater
<strong>randh</strong>, picking release times between 1 and 30 milliseconds. </p>
<pre><code> 0.001 0.03 10 randh tenvx</code></pre>
<h2>Filtered Noise</h2>
<p>The noise is multiplied by the envelope generator. </p>
<pre><code> 0.5 noise *</code></pre>
<p>The cutoff frequency of the filter is controlled by a random line generator 
generating values between 500 and 4000. The rate of the random line is
determined by p-register 3. </p>
<pre><code> 500 4000 3 p 3 40 scale randi </code></pre>
<p>The resononace of the filter is also determined by p-register 3. 
This particular filter design has a resonance range of 0 to 2. 
This high resonance amount causes a lot of self oscillations. This is what
causes the sinusoidal sounds. </p>
<pre><code> 3 p 1.7 1.9 scale </code></pre>
<p>The last parameter of <strong>wpkorg35</strong> is distortion amount. </p>
<pre><code> 1.11 wpkorg35</code></pre>
<h2>Smooth Delay</h2>
<p><strong>smoothdelay</strong> is a double delay line that linearly interpolates 
them any time the delay time changes. This causes a delay line that
can smoothly change delay times. Hence, the name.</p>
<p>The input signal is duplicated, one being sent into the delay line. 
The feedback of the delay line is determined by p-register 2. </p>
<pre><code> dup 2 p 0.1 0.99 scale</code></pre>
<p>The clock signal is obtained from the table <em>trig</em>, and sent into a 
clock divider, turning the sixteenth notes into quarter notes.</p>
<pre><code> 0 _trig tget 4 0 tdiv </code></pre>
<p>This signal triggers the triggerable random number genrator <strong>trand</strong>.
The value of <strong>trand</strong> determines the delay time of <strong>smoothdelay</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 0.001 0.29 trand</code></pre>
<p>The maximum delay time and the interpolation time (in samples) are the 
final parameters to <strong>smoothdelay</strong>. Is is then scaled and added to
the dry signal.</p>
<pre><code> 0.4 1024 smoothdelay 0.3 * +

</code></pre>
