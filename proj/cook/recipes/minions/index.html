<p>[<a href="/res/cook/the_minions_are_coming_tho.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>This <a href="/sporthlings/003">sporthling</a> leverages the ability to use 
tables as sequencers and patterns in Sporth. There are a two melodic
"themes" played layered along side some white noise bursts.
<h2>Variables and Tables</h2>
<p>Before anything is started, the variables and tables are declared. </p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>A variable called <em>clk</em> is used to store clock data. </li>
<li>A table called <em>seq</em> stores MIDI note numbers. for the main melodic 
sequence.<br />  </li>
<li><p>A variable called <em>nt</em> is used to store a midi note value. Here it is
being set to midi note number 55.</p>
<p>  <em>clk var
  </em>seq "74 72 70 69 67" gen<em>vals
  </em>bs "43 41 39 38 43 45 46 48" gen<em>vals
  </em>nt 55 varset</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Clock</h2>
<p>The clock used for all the timing elements in the patch are set using
<strong>metro</strong>, whose rate is randomly warped using <strong>randi</strong> and <strong>randh</strong>.
I use this drifting clock approach in patches mainly to break any "groove" 
that would occur. In breaking the groove, the piece becomes more fluid and
organic.</p>
<pre><code> 0.5 10 (1 3 5 randh) randi metro _clk set </code></pre>
<h2>Lead </h2>
<p>The main element in this patch is this lead sound. It is a surprisingly
complex element comprised of two sound sources blended together. 
Each component of the lead sound has been broken into into sections.
<h3>Envelope 1</h3>
<p>At the time of making this patch, <strong>tseg</strong> was a newly added soundpipe
module and sporth ugen that I wanted to build an intuition about. For this 
reason, all the envelopes generated in this patch were created using 
<strong>tseg</strong>. It is worth examining one of envelopes in detail.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>tseg</strong> is a trigger-based line generator, capable of generating lines 
with various kinds of slopes. These can range from convex exponential shapes 
to concave exponential shapes. </p>
<p>The first argument is a trigger signal, which will make <strong>tseg</strong> jump
to a given value.</p>
<pre><code> _clk get </code></pre>
<p>The value it jumps to is the second argument. An envelope jumps to either
1 or 0. To generate this, the clock signal is duplicated and fed into
<strong>tog</strong>. </p>
<pre><code> dup tog </code></pre>
<p>The duration of <strong>tseg</strong> is the third argument. It is being fed with 
the triggerable random number generator <strong>trand</strong> driven by the clock 
signal. The range of time is between 5 and 500 milliseconds. </p>
<pre><code> _clk get 0.005 0.5 trand </code></pre>
<p>The fourth argument determines the curve of the line segment. This value
is being set between -10 and 5. Negative values will produce convex envelope
attacks, while positive values will produce concave envelope attacks. 
The larger the value, the steeper the curve in either direction.</p>
<pre><code> _clk get -10 5 trand </code></pre>
<p>Finally, tseg is called. The last and final parameter is the initial 
value for the line segment, which has been to 0. <strong>tseg</strong> produces a value
and pushes it onto the stack for later use.</p>
<pre><code> 0 tseg </code></pre>
<h3>Square </h3>
<p>One of the timbres used is a bandlimited square wave. For starters,
it has a pitch of an 'E' above middle C (midi note number 74) and
an amplitude of 0.3</p>
<pre><code> 74 mtof 0.3 </code></pre>
<p>The pulse width of the square wave is modulated with another envelope 
generator via <strong>tseg</strong>. As it turns out, this envelope generator is
identical to the envelope described above.</p>
<pre><code> _clk get 0.5 maytrig dup tog 
 _clk get 0.005 0.5 trand 
 _clk get -10 5 trand 
 0 tseg </code></pre>
<p>The output of <strong>tseg</strong> is in the range 0-1, and since 0 and 1 exactly
are out of range for <strong>square</strong>, it is rescaled to be between 0.1 and 0.5.</p>
<pre><code> 0.1 0.5 scale</code></pre>
<p><strong>square</strong> is called, and the value produced is pushed onto the stack. At
this point the stack contents are the envelope and the square.</p>
<pre><code> square</code></pre>
<h3>FM</h3>
<p>The second timbral contribution to the lead sound is a FM oscillator pair.
The frequency of this oscillator is set using a sequence built using
the <em>seq</em> table from before and <strong>tseq</strong>. Instead of using the clock signal
from before, the FM using a new clock signal generated using <strong>metro</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 4 metro 0.5 maytrig 0 _seq tseq </code></pre>
<p>Oftentimes the jumps caused by the sequencer lead to undesirable clicks. 
the steps between the notes are smoothed via a portamento filter <strong>port</strong>, 
then fed into <strong>mtof</strong> to be converted into a frequency. </p>
<pre><code> 0.01 port mtof </code></pre>
<p>The rest of the FM oscillator pair <strong>fm</strong> is fairly vanilla. It has an
amplitude of 0.4, with a 2:7 C:M ratio, and a modulation index of 5. This
particular C:M ratio is particularly bright with spread out harmonics. The
higher-than-usual modulation index adds to the brightness of the FM sound.</p>
<pre><code> 0.4 2 7 5 fm </code></pre>
<p><strong>fm</strong> computes a sample and pushes that value onto the stack. Now there
is an envelope signal, a square signal, and an FM signal. </p>
<h3>Blending</h3>
<p>The square signal and FM signal generated in the previous two subsections
are to be blended together via a linear crossfade called <strong>cf</strong>. 
The position of the crossfade is determined via <strong>randi</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 0 0.8 1 randi cf</code></pre>
<p>To mellow things out, the lead is fed through a butterworth lowpass filter.
The cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter is determined via a <strong>randi</strong>
ugen in the range 700 to 1000, whose rate is 13 times a second.</p>
<pre><code> 700 1000 (13 bpm2rate) randi butlp</code></pre>
<p>The envelope generated from before is multiplied with the lead signal.</p>
<pre><code> *</code></pre>
<h3>Envelope 2</h3>
<p>The signal generated above works, but there are now spaces or pauses. This
gets fatiguing to the ears very quickly. To add space, the signal is hit
with another envelope buit to add space. The amount influence this envelope 
has is modulated as well via another crossfade <strong>cf</strong>, crossing between
a steady signal of 1 and the signal itself. The crossfade first begins
with such a steady signal. It is just a value of 1.</p>
<pre><code> 1 </code></pre>
<p>The second signal in the crossfade is the second envelope. A new metronome
<strong>metro</strong>, whose rate is randomly determined via <strong>randh</strong>, is fed into
a toggle signal <strong>tog</strong>. To smooth the transitions generated by <strong>tog</strong>,
it is fed into a portamento filter. </p>
<pre><code> (30 50 1 randh metro tog 0.001 port) 
 </code></pre>
<p>The position randomly switches between the steady state signal and the
envelope with a signal created from a <strong>metro</strong>, a <strong>maygate</strong>, and 
a <strong>portamento</strong> to smooth things out.</p>
<pre><code> 10 metro 0.4 maygate 0.003 port</code></pre>
<p>The crossfaded signal is produced and multiplied with the current signal.</p>
<pre><code> cf * </code></pre>
<h3>Feedback Delay </h3>
<p>Some feedback delay is added to the lead sound. The feedback amount is
set to 900 milliseconds, and the delay time is 1.1 seconds. It is attenuated
and added to the dry signal. This summed signal is also attenuated as well
to make room for the bass.</p>
<pre><code> dup 0.9 1.1 delay -6 ampdb *  + -6 ampdb * </code></pre>
<h2>Bass</h2>
<p>The bass sound used is your run-of-the-mill supersaw subtractive bass. 
Nothing too unusual is happening here, but it still sounds great.
<h3>Sequencer</h3>
<p>Yet another independent clock signal is generated for the bass sequencer,
this time using <strong>dmetro</strong> set to 90 beats per minute via <strong>bpm2dur</strong></p>
</p>
<pre><code> 90 bpm2dur dmetro </code></pre>
<p>The trigger signal is fed into a trigger divider <strong>tdiv</strong>, which takes
the clock signal and only spits out a trigger every 4 ticks. 
This effectively turns a quarter note signal into a signal that ticks
once per measure in 4/4 time. </p>
<pre><code> 4 0 tdiv </code></pre>
<p>This clock signal is made even more sparse when it is fed into a maytrig
with a 40% probability. <strong>tick</strong> is added onto this signal to ensure that
there is a starting note when the patch begins.</p>
<pre><code> 0.8 maytrig tick + </code></pre>
<p>The rest of tseq is outlined below. Tseq is set to mode 0, which means
move in sequential order.</p>
<pre><code> 0 _bs tseq </code></pre>
<p>To smooth the jumps between notes, a portamento filter <strong>port</strong> is used.</p>
<pre><code> 0.01 port </code></pre>
<p>The signal generated is to be used multiple times, so to save on stack 
operations, it is stored into the variable <em>nt</em>.</p>
<pre><code> _nt set</code></pre>
<h3>Sawtooths</h3>
<p>Using the sequencer signal generated above, three sawtooth oscillators 
are summed together. The two detuned oscillators are shifted one octave
below.</p>
<pre><code> _nt get mtof 0.1 saw 
 _nt get 12.1 - mtof 0.2 saw 
 _nt get 11.9 - mtof 0.1 saw + + </code></pre>
<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>The output signal the bass is fed into a butterworth lowpass filter, whose
cutoff is being modulated via <strong>rand</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 300 900 0.2 randi butlp +</code></pre>
<h2>White Noise</h2>
<p>The final signal in this patch is a enveloped white noise burst. 
It is not too shocking that one of the elements is white noise.</p>
<pre><code> 0.4 noise </code></pre>
<p>The envelope signal has a clock signal generated via <strong>metro</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 15 metro </code></pre>
<p>This clock signal is duplicated and fed into <strong>tdiv</strong> to output a tick 
every 4 ticks on the input. This signal is fed into a maygate, which is
used to effectively shut the noise on and off. </p>
<pre><code> dup 4 0 tdiv 0.2 maygate * </code></pre>
<p><strong>swap</strong> is utilized to get the copy of the clock signal created. It is 
fed into a maytrig to make it more sparse. </p>
<pre><code> swap 0.9 maytrig </code></pre>
<p>This trigger signal is then fed into <strong>tgate</strong>. When triggered, <strong>tgate</strong>
will produce a gate signal for .5 millseconds. This tiny gate is then
smoothed out using <strong>port</strong> and multiplied with the white noise signal to
get a rhythmic clackity click.</p>
<pre><code> 0.0005 tgate 0.001 port *  </code></pre>
<p>Finally, this white noise signal is added into everything that has occured
before it.</p>
<pre><code> +</code></pre>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>The effect chain consists of a reverb module and a peak limiter. Before
any signals are processed, a copy of the signal is made.
The signal is then fed into <strong>zrev</strong>, the simplified zita reverb module 
ugen. Before it is fed in, it is sent through a high pass filter. This is
to give the dry bass sound more clarity and to make things less muddy.</p>
<pre><code> 200 buthp dup 20 10 4000 zrev drop -3 ampdb * +</code></pre>
<p>Before being sent to the speakers, the final mix is sent through a peak 
limiter and bumped up 3db.</p>
<pre><code> 0.1 0.001 -3 peaklim 3 ampdb * 

</code></pre>
