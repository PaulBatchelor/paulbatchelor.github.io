<pre><code> # Scheale
 # By Paul Batchelor
 # August 2015</code></pre>
<p>As the date in original comment header would suggest, 
<em>Scheale</em> was one of the first compositions written in Sporth. 
<em>Scheale</em> was written in the mountains of Pennsylvania on an old
thinkpad laptop while overlooking Ganoga lake. As it so happens, I find 
myself writing this documentation up, sitting in the same place a year later.</p>
<p>Many things have changed since this piece was written. Maygate, for instance
used to be combination of maytrig and maygate. Arithmetic opererations 
would words like mul, div, add, sub and not /, *, +, and -. Clip has gone
through some fixes as well. Nevertheless, the essence of <em>Scheale</em> remains
the same.</p>
<p>This patch is the main component of <em>Scheale</em>. The entirety of the composition 
contains two Sporth patches and nature samples recorded
where this piece was mostly written. </p>
<h2>Table generation</h2>
<p>The tables used in this piece contain two pitch sets, which are swtiched
back and forth between one another. The first sequence contain the pitches
D, A, E, A. </p>
<pre><code> &quot;seq_1&quot;
 &quot;62 69 64 69&quot;
 gen_vals</code></pre>
<p>The second sequence contains pitches C sharp, E, F sharp, and B.</p>
<pre><code> &quot;seq_2&quot;
 &quot;73 76 66 71&quot;
 gen_vals</code></pre>
<h2>Clock source</h2>
<p>The main clock source used is the <em>prop</em> ugen. Prop was a micro-notation
language I wrote prior to writing Sporth. I have since then created
a port of in to exist inside Soundpipe and Sporth. The rhythm used
is "+2(++)--", which can be read is a quarter, two eigths, followed by
two quarter rests. The tempo is set to a rather slow 54 BPM. </p>
<p>The output of clock is sent through a branch. This was initially done
in order to add a delay to the start of the patch in the larger composition. 
Since this is only one part of the composition, the branch has been permantly
set to choose the prop clock source.</p>
<pre><code> 1
 54 &quot;+2(++)--&quot; prop 0 branch</code></pre>
<p>The output clock signal is put through a maytrig, which makes the clock
trigger 78 percent of the time. It is then duplicated on the stack.</p>
<pre><code> 0.78 maytrig dup</code></pre>
<h2>Envelopes</h2>
<p>The main envelope used is <em>tenv</em>, a triggered linear envelope generator.
the release time of the envelope is randomized via <em>randi</em> to be between
500 and 800 milliseconds. </p>
<pre><code> 0.004 0.05 0.5 0.8 0.2 randi tenv </code></pre>
<p>After <em>tenv</em>, the clock signal is brought back to the top of the stack
and duplicated, so it can be used in the modal filters.</p>
<pre><code> swap dup</code></pre>
<h2>Modal filters</h2>
<p>The main means of sound generation uses a technique known as modal 
synthesis. An impulse (created from the clock)
is sent through a series of modal filters, where
resonances are added to create percusive sounds that are somewhere between
metallic and glass. The first series of modal filters here is used
to create an excitation signal. Later on, they will be fed into
another series of modal filters to create a sounding pitch.</p>
<pre><code> dup 1000 12 mode
 swap 3000 8 mode
 add 0.3 mul dup</code></pre>
<h2>Sequencing</h2>
<p>The sequencing part of <em>Scheale</em> is by far the trickiest thing to 
understand, due to the heavy use of stack operations (tables and variables
did not exist at this time). </p>
<p>At its core, the sequencer is made up of two tseqs  being fed by the clock
signal in parallel. The stack operations used are meant to bring shuffle
the clock signal to tseq. </p>
<pre><code> rot dup dup 0 &quot;seq_2&quot; tseq
 swap dup 0 &quot;seq_1&quot; tseq</code></pre>
<p>At this point, the stack has now been prepared in such a way so that the 
last three items look like this: tseq1, clock, tseq2. The clock is swapped
into a 50-50 maytrig, which becomes the trigger that switches between
the two sequences via switch. Because trig is the first argument, and 
not the last, two rots are ended to align the arguments correctly.</p>
<pre><code> swap 0.5 maytrig rot rot switch</code></pre>
<p>The clock signal (yes, there is still a copy of the clock signal 
on the stack), is used again to drive a counter that counts from zero
to two. Every time it reaches 0, 12 is added to the sequence. In other
words, every three notes the sequence leaps an octave.</p>
<pre><code> swap 3 0 count 0 eq 12 0 branch add</code></pre>
<p>To add some glissando in between the notes, a portamento filter is 
added to the signal before they are fed into the modal filters.</p>
<pre><code> 0.001 port</code></pre>
<h2>More modal filters</h2>
<p>Now that an excitation signal and a sequence has been created, these 
can be fed into the second series of modal filters which will create
the pitched sounds. </p>
<p>Slight jitter is added onto the note sequence before it is converted
to a frequency. This is a crude attempt to add the "drift" commonly
experienced in analogue hardware.</p>
<pre><code> -0.15 0.15 0.2 randi add</code></pre>
<p>The midi note number is converted to frequency. The stack is shuffled
in such a way so that the arguments line up for the first modal filter,
and so there is also a copy of the frequency on the stack. The Q of the
filter is randomized via <em>randi</em>.</p>
<pre><code> mtof dup rot swap
 300 2000 0.12 randi mode</code></pre>
<p>Once again the arguments on the stack are aligned for the second 
modal filter. The Q of this filter is also randomized with a different
<em>randi</em>.</p>
<pre><code> swap rot swap 2.01081 mul 100 1000 0.1 randi mode</code></pre>
<p>The two modal filters are summed together, then scaled down, as they 
are very very loud.</p>
<pre><code> add 0.15 mul
 mul</code></pre>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>The effects used consist of clip distortion, a feedback filtered delay line,
and a very large reverb. </p>
<p>Firstly, the sound is put through clip distortion, highly truncating
the waveform to give it grit. This is then dulled via a butterworth
lowpass filter.</p>
<pre><code> 0.3 clip 1000 butlp</code></pre>
<p>This signal is fed through a delay line of 750 milliseconds. It is 
attenuated and fed through another 1000Hz lowpass filter.</p>
<pre><code> dup 0.76 0.75 delay 0.2 mul 1000 butlp</code></pre>
<p>The dry undelayed signal is fed through reverbsc. Both channels of
reverbsc are used, so they are both equally attenuated.</p>
<pre><code> swap dup dup 0.97 10000 revsc 0.3 mul swap 0.3 mul</code></pre>
<p>From this point forward, the signal being treated is stereo. For this 
reason, many stack operations are used. At the end of the day, what these
stack operations are doing is mixing the dry signal and delayed reverb
signal together.</p>
<p>This is the first channel.</p>
<pre><code> rot dup rot add
 rot rot add </code></pre>
<p>This is the second channel.</p>
<pre><code> rot dup rot add
 rot rot add </code></pre>
<p>For now, all sporth cookbook patches are mono, so we will drop a channel.</p>
<pre><code> drop</code></pre>
<p>That being said, the reverb sounds very good in stereo!
The end.</p>
