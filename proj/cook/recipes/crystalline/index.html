<h1>Crystalline</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/crystalline.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>Another sporthling created for the AudioKit sporth editor. It features
a Karplus-Strong pluck and a phase-vocoder buffer shuffler. 
The controls are the following:
<ul>
<li>Control 1: Feedback</li>
<li>Control 2: Tempo</li>
<li>Control 3: Dry/Wet</li>
<li>Control 4: Probability</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>A buffer for audio is created and zeroed out.</p>
<pre><code> 'buf' 80000 zeros</code></pre>
<p>An argument table is created to store some parameters.</p>
<pre><code> _tk 2 zeros</code></pre>
<p>A table is created containing a musical sequence.</p>
<pre><code> 'seq' '0 2 7 11 14 4 2' gen_vals</code></pre>
<h2>Clock </h2>
<p><strong>tick</strong> will output a single trigger at the start of a sporth patch.
It can only be used once, so the output must be copied somewhere else, in
this case our table <em>tk</em>. </p>
<pre><code> tick 0 _tk tset</code></pre>
<p>Our clock consists of 3
parts: 
the tick signal, guaranteeing a trigger at the beginning of the patch, </p>
<pre><code> 0 _tk tget</code></pre>
<p>the metronome signal, whose rate is set by p-register 1,</p>
<pre><code> 1 p 1 5 scale metro</code></pre>
<p>and the metronome goes into the maytrig, whose probability is determined by 
p-register 3. </p>
<pre><code> 3 p 0.4 1.0 scale
 maytrig + </code></pre>
<p>This clock signal is copied into index 1 of the table <em>tk</em> for later use,
then duplicated for more imediate use. <em>(It is also possible to 
use table instead of the stack, but the patch evolved this way.)</em></p>
<pre><code> dup 1 _tk tset
 dup</code></pre>
<h2>Pluck</h2>
<p>The Karplus Strong pluck is the fundamental sound source in this patch. 
The other aspects of the patch process this sound.</p>
<p>The clock signal from the previous section triggers a tseq, whose mode
is 0, which means it will move sequentially through the table. </p>
<pre><code> 0 'seq' tseq</code></pre>
<p>This sequence is biased to 61 (Db major ish), and converted to a frequency
via mtof.</p>
<pre><code> 61 + mtof</code></pre>
<p>The rest of the pluck module is pretty typical. It is put through a lowpass
filter to smooth out the pluck sound a bit.</p>
<pre><code> 0.9 400 pluck 1000 butlp</code></pre>
<p>The pluck is split and put into a static delay line, whose feedback is
determined by p-register 0.</p>
<pre><code> dup 0 p 0.01 0.9 scale 0.01 port 0.75 delay </code></pre>
<p>The output of the delay is put through a highpass filter and attenuated
a little bit. Then, it is mixed back into the dry signal. </p>
<pre><code> 1000 buthp 0.7 * +</code></pre>
<p>The pluck is fed into the zita-reverb with a very long decay time. 
A dc blocker is put on the end of it for good measure. </p>
<pre><code> dup dup 10 10 8000 zrev drop 0.5 * + dcblk</code></pre>
<p>The entire signal created so far is sent into <strong>tblrec</strong>, which "records"
the audio input into the buffer. The tick signal created earlier is needed
here for <strong>tblrec</strong>, which will leave it recording indefinitely.</p>
<pre><code> dup 0 _tk tget 'buf' tblrec</code></pre>
<h2>Mincer </h2>
<p>Mincer is a phase vocoder, which allows control of position and pitch
of an ftable independent of one another. In this case, the ftable being 
used is the buffer, which is being constantly rewritten via <strong>tblrec</strong></p>
<p>Wavetable position is a slow random walk.</p>
<pre><code> 0 'buf' tbldur 0.3 randi </code></pre>
<p>Ampltiude is 1. No attenuation.</p>
<pre><code> 1</code></pre>
<p>Next argument is the playback rate. 
The clock signal drives a random number generator, which picks values between
1 and 3. These numbers are truncated to be integers via floor.
This is done so the play back rate can be one of three states: normal (1),
one octave up (2), and one octave and fifth up (3). Restricting these states
makes things sound more pretty and in key.</p>
<pre><code> 1 _tk tget 1 3 trand floor </code></pre>
<p>The last argument of mincer is the buffer.</p>
<pre><code> 'buf' mincer</code></pre>
<h2>Chorusing Delay</h2>
<p>The output of mincer is sent into this chorusing delay effect. It is a 
feedback delay sent through a (surprise) chorus made up of pitch shifters.</p>
<p>The feedback delay has a somewhat high feedback, and a very long delay time.</p>
<pre><code> dup 0.7 1.5 delay 0.7 *</code></pre>
<p>The output of this delay is put into two pitch shifters in parallel. 
The first pitch shifter raises the pitch by 0.11 semitones, the second
drops the pitch by 0.1 semitones. The dry delayline signal and pitch 
shifters are then mixed together.</p>
<pre><code> dup 0.11 1024 512 pshift
 rot dup -0.1 1024 512 pshift + +</code></pre>
<pre><code> + -10 ampdb *</code></pre>
<h2>Wet/Dry</h2>
<p>At this point, there are two items on the stack: the pluck signal,
and the chorused mincer signal. A crossfade is used to switch between
these two signals. The position of this crossfade is determined by 
p-register 2. The subtraction is needed to flip the signals.
The final signal is duplicated to work on a stero signal.</p>
<pre><code> 1 2 p 0.01 port - cf</code></pre>
