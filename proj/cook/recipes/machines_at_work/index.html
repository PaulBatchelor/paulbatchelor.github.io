<h1>Machines at Work</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/machines_at_work.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>Machines at work is yet another example which showcases how Sporth can be
used to produce sequenced music. It is comprised of main sounds with 
aux efects.
<h2>Tables and Variables</h2>
<p>Being a largely sequenced patch, this patch is highly reliant on tables:
<ul>
<li>the table <em>sine</em> uses <strong>gen_sinesum</strong> to produce a summation of 
harmonically related sine waves</li>
<li>the table <em>seq</em> uses gen_rand to generated a random distribution for
use with tseq, with an emphasis on note "38", then "41", then "43". </li>
<li>the table <strong>sqrseq</strong> is the sequence used by the square instrument</li>
</ul>
</p>
</p>
<pre><code> _sine 8192 &quot;1 0 0.1 0.8 0.8&quot; gen_sinesum
 _seq 32 &quot;38 0.7 41 0.2 43 0.1&quot; gen_rand
 _sqrseq &quot;74 77 79 81&quot; gen_vals</code></pre>
<p>The patch also uses three variables. 
<ul>
<li>the variable <em>rms</em> stores the RMS of the bass</li>
<li>the variable <em>bass</em> stores the signal of the bass</li>
<li>the variable <em>clk</em> holds the clock signal</li>
<li>the variable <em>note</em> stores the note of the bass</li>
</ul>
</p>
<pre><code> _rms var
 _bass var
 _clk var
 _note var</code></pre>
<h2>Bass</h2>
<p>To begin, a clock signal is generated via <strong>dmetro</strong> and <strong>bpm2dur</strong>. 
To get sixteenths notes, the tempo (92), is multiplied by 4. We set this
to the variable <em>clk</em> so it can easily be used throughout the patch.</p>
<pre><code> 92 4 * bpm2dur dmetro _clk set</code></pre>
<p>The bass sequence is created using <strong>tseq</strong> in shuffle mode, using the 
table and weighted random distribution <em>seq</em>. Before being sent to 
<strong>tseq</strong>, the clock signal <em>clk</em> is fed through a clock divider to 
effectively get eigth notes.</p>
<pre><code> _clk get 2 0 tdiv 1 _seq tseq 0.001 port _note set</code></pre>
<p>The bass instrument is composed of three oscillators, the first two
being FM oscillators via <strong>fosc</strong>. These are slightly detuned and an octave
apart from one another. Each oscillator has their own sinusoidal LFO 
controlling modulation index, which effectively controls the brightness.
To add more grit, the usually sine lookup table supplied to <strong>fosc</strong> 
has extra harmonics for some extra grit. </p>
<pre><code> _note get mtof 0.1 2 1 (0.1 1 sine 1 3 biscale) _sine fosc
 _note get 12.1 - mtof 0.1 1 1 (0.1 1 sine 4 7 biscale) _sine fosc +</code></pre>
<p>The third oscillator is a triangle wave, tuned a fifth up. </p>
<pre><code> _note get 7 + mtof 0.2 tri +</code></pre>
<p>Next, the the signal is modulated by the exponential envelope signal 
generator <strong>tenvx</strong>. A copy of the <strong>tenvx</strong> signal is saved to the 
variable <em>rms</em>. </p>
<pre><code> _clk get 2 0 tdiv 0.001 0.01 0.3 tenvx dup _rms set * </code></pre>
<p>the bass filter is passed through a lowpass filter <strong>butlp</strong> with a 3000
hz cutoff, and then saved to the variable <em>bass</em> for later. </p>
<pre><code> 3000 butlp _bass set</code></pre>
<h2>Square</h2>
<p>The second instrument created is a square oscillator instrument. 
To begin, the envelope signal is generated from <em>clk</em>. A copy of clk is
created to be used next.</p>
<pre><code> _clk get dup 0.001 0.02 0.1 tenvx </code></pre>
<p>The envelope and the clock signal <strong>swap</strong> places, so that <em>clk</em> can feed
<strong>tseq</strong>. This generates the sequencer signal for the square wave.</p>
<pre><code> swap 0 _sqrseq tseq </code></pre>
<p>The clock is retrieved once more, and fed into a maygate signal, which
is then scaled by 12, and then added to the sequence signal. 
This has the effect of making the sequence occasionally jump an octave.</p>
<pre><code> _clk get 0.2 maygate 12 * +</code></pre>
<p>To smooth jumps between the notes, the portamento filter <strong>port</strong> is used,
then the MIDI value is converted to frequency with <strong>mtof</strong>. </p>
<pre><code> 0.005 port mtof</code></pre>
<p>Next, the amplitude of the square oscillator is set to 0.3</p>
<pre><code> 0.3 </code></pre>
<p>The pulse width is determined by a sinusoidal LFO, scaled between 0.2 and
0.8. </p>
<pre><code> 10 inv 1 sine 0.2 0.8 biscale </code></pre>
<p>Afterwards, <strong>square</strong> is finally called, and then multiplied with the 
envelope signal generated previously. This signal is then put through a
butterworth lowpass filter with a 2kHz cutoff.</p>
<pre><code> square *  2000 butlp</code></pre>
<p>Next, the square signal is put through a tempo-synced delay, timed to work
at a 3 sixteenth note time delay.</p>
<pre><code> dup 0.7 92 bpm2dur 0.75 * delay 1000 butlp -4 ampdb * + </code></pre>
<h2>Pads</h2>
<p>The bulk of the pad sound is mostly built from three bandlimited 
sawtooth oscillators. Examining a single oscillator, it can be seen that
a fixed pitch is assigned, and the amplitude is being modulated via
a randome line segment generator <strong>randi</strong>. </p>
<pre><code> 76 mtof 0 0.2 0.2 randi saw </code></pre>
<p>This gets duplicated two more times, with different pitches and 
instances of <strong>randi</strong>. They are all combined together into one signal.</p>
<pre><code> 65 mtof 0 0.2 0.5 randi saw +
 67 mtof 0 0.2 1 randi saw +</code></pre>
<p>The pad signal is fed through a <strong>moogladder</strong> ugen. The cutoff frequency
is modulated by an LFO signal, scaled between values 1000 and 3000. The
<strong>moogladder</strong> ugen loses gain with the resonance set to a high 0.5, so 
the signal is doubled. </p>
<pre><code> 12 inv 1 sine 1000 3000 biscale 0.5 moogladder 2 *  </code></pre>
<p>This signal is fed through a delay, timed to work with a quarter note 
delay time.</p>
<pre><code> dup 0.7 92 bpm2dur delay 1000 buthp -3 ampdb * + +</code></pre>
<h2>Noise</h2>
<p>The final sound added to the mix is a percussive white noise instrument.
Unlike the previous sounds, this uses its own clock signal, but it is
synced to the same tempo as the clock. For the clock signal, <strong>prop</strong> is
used. Prop is a microlanguage within Sporth for generating complex rhythms.</p>
<pre><code> 92 &quot;-+|-2(-+)|-4(++--)|-?-4(-+-+)&quot; prop </code></pre>
<p>The prop signal is fed through maytrig to make it less dense...</p>
<pre><code> 0.7 maytrig</code></pre>
<p>...which in turn is used to produce an exponential envelope signal via
<strong>tenvx</strong>.</p>
<pre><code> 0.001 0.1 0.1 tenvx </code></pre>
<p>Next is the noise source is generated by <strong>randh</strong> being modulated at
audio rate  with <strong>randh</strong>. Then it is fed through <strong>butlp</strong>. </p>
<pre><code> (-0.3 0.3 sr (1 5 13 randh) / randh) * 4000 butlp</code></pre>
<p>The ampltiude of the noise source is modulated by a morphing signal 
via <strong>cf</strong>. The first signal is a series of tiny gate signals generated
with <strong>tgate</strong>, whose parameters are being randomly modulated.</p>
<pre><code> (10 40 1 randh) metro (0.001 0.015 2 randi) tgate </code></pre>
<p>The next signal is just a constant "on" signal 1.</p>
<pre><code> 1 </code></pre>
<p>These two signals are crossfaded from one to the other via a smoothed
toggle signal <strong>tog</strong>, synced up with the clock signal <em>clk</em>. </p>
<pre><code> _clk get 0.5 maytrig tog 0.01 port 
 cf *</code></pre>
<p>This generated signal is fed througha tempo sycned feedback delay, set 
to a delay line of 3 sixteenths notes. </p>
<pre><code> dup 0.7 92 bpm2dur 0.75 * delay -10 ampdb * + </code></pre>
<p>This instrument is then piled onto everything else on the stack.</p>
<pre><code> +</code></pre>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Before the effects are prossed, every instrument (minus the bass), is 
scaled by "rms" signal of the bass (which is actually just the amplitude
of the bass). The signal can be scaled between -3 and 2 db. 
This acts as a bootleg signal ducker. When the bass turns on, the rest 
of the instruments back off.</p>
<pre><code> 1 _rms get - -3 2 scale ampdb * </code></pre>
<p>To give the bass even more space, we put the isntruments through a highpass
filter. </p>
<pre><code> 500 buthp</code></pre>
<p>These instruments are fed through the chowning reverb <strong>jcrev</strong>. </p>
<pre><code> dup jcrev 3 ampdb * +</code></pre>
<p>The bass signal from what back is retrieved from <em>bass</em>, and given a bass
boost via eqfil. Then, everything is summed together and attenuated a 
bit so things do not clip.</p>
<pre><code> _bass get  100 20 3 eqfil + -2 ampdb * </code></pre>
