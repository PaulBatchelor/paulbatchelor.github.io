<h1>P Registers</h1>
<p>P-registers were an early way to shared information without using the stack. 
It is simply an array accessible to Sporth where values can be easily 
read/written to. At the moment, there are 16 p-registers. </p>
<p>Here is a simple patch demonstrating this:</p>
<pre><code> 440 0 pset
 0 p 0.3 sine</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the value of p-register 0 is being set to 440 via 
<strong>pset</strong>. In the line below, the value of p-register 0 is being read with
<strong>p</strong>.</p>
<p>The very nifty thing about p-registers is that they are trivial to read/write 
from when using the API. P-registers are a fast solution for people who want to quickly
bind values into Sporth (or alternatively, send audio-signals out of sporth). </p>
<p>A little silly side note on P-registers: the "P" stands for parameter. The term
itself is borrowed from Csound, where p-fields, or parameter fields, are
optional values read from a Csound score. </p>
