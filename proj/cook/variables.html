<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>Variables in Sporth are a wonderful solution to mitigate 
hard to follow stack operations. </p>
<p>Consider this Sporth patch, where the metronome signal is being split
and fed into a trand and tenvx:</p>
<pre><code> 10 metro dup
 300 1000 trand 
 swap 0.001 0.005 0.001 tenvx 
 swap 0.3 sine *</code></pre>
<p>It's not terribly complicated yet, but if this patch were to grow, and the clock
source were needed by more ugens, things could become harder to follow.</p>
<p>With variables, the same patch could be realized in the following way:</p>
<pre><code> _clk var
 10 metro _clk set
 _clk get 300 1000 trand 
 _clk get 0.001 0.005 0.001 tenvx 
 swap 0.3 sine * </code></pre>
<p>In this patch, the variable called "clk" is declared in the first line with:</p>
<pre><code> _clk var</code></pre>
<p>The metronome signal is set to the variable using "set" in the following line:
<pre><code> 
 10 metro _clk set</code></pre>
</p>
<p>With the variable set, the value inside the variable accessed using "get",
as seen in the two lines following:</p>
<pre><code> _clk get 300 1000 trand 
 _clk get 0.001 0.005 0.001 tenvx </code></pre>
<p>With this patch, it is much clearer to see what is being fed into trand and
tenvx. </p>
