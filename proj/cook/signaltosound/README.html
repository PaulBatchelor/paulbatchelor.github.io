<h1>Signal To Sound</h1>
<p>This is a work in progress tutorial for Sporth. The goals this tutorial are
twofold. Not only will this tutorial seek to provide foundational information
on fundamental computer-based synthesis techniques, but it will also aim to 
help develop a deep understanding for how to use them in a modular environment. 
This idea is something I'd to call <em>sonic intuition</em>. </p>
<p>The term "signal to sound" comes from the idea of building intuition on certain
synthesis techniques and sounds from modulating it with known signals. The
tutorial will be sequential, each patch building on sonic intuition gained from
the chapters preceding it.</p>
<p>In the first section, the low-frequency sinusoidal
oscillator (LFO) and fundamental concept of modulation will be illustrated. 
From there, the harmonic series will be derived. This will be a smooth transition
into talking about subtractive/additive synthesis, common wavetable oscillator shapes, 
as well as a discussion on timbre and sonority. From there, FM synthesis 
and a simple FM operator pair will be derived from first principles. Following
that, sonic intution about the FM parameters (C:M ratio, modulation index) will be 
built up. </p>
<p>At this point, there will brief discussion on rhythm and density in the computer
music domain. </p>
<p>The final section will be on any fun topics that don't quite fit the mold 
described above. </p>
