<h1>The Sine</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/the_sine.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>The first signal to be examined will be the sine wave. It many ways, it can
be regarded as the atomic element in sound design. The sine wave will 
provide the foundations needed for building up sonic intuition.</p>
<p>When plotted, the sine wave has a very distinct shape:</p>
<p>INSERT IMAGE OF SINE WAVE HERE</p>
<p>When played as audio, the sine wave has a "pure" sound. In some
areas of music cognition and psychoacoustics, sine waves are actually 
known as "pure tones". </p>
<p>The patch below has two sine waves working together. One of these sine 
waves creates the sound as an <em>audio signal</em>. The other is a sine wave is
a <em>control signal</em>,
whose frequency is sub audio (0.1 Hertz), and is scaled to modulate the 
frequency of the other sine wave. This type of control signal is referred
to as a low-frequency oscillator, or LFO.</p>
<p>What separates a control signal from an audio signal? Well, not a whole lot
really. In Sporth, there is no formal distinction. Anything that reaches
a speaker can be considered an audio signal. In many cases, it is helpful
to think of everything as simply a signal. All signals have potential
to be a sound. All sounds have potential to be a signal. </p>
<p>Listen to the patch below. Take careful note of the sonic characteristics
of the sine wave and the way the frequency is being modulated by the LFO. 
In future sections, both signals will come back again in different ways. 
Be ready...</p>
