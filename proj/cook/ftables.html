<h1>ftables and gen routines</h1>
<p>F-tables, or "function tables" are terms that I borrowed from the Csound 
language. Simply put, ftables are arrays of floating point values. They are
often used by audio-rate signal generators in Sporth like samplers and table-lookup
oscillators. </p>
<p>F-tables in Sporth are coupled with gen routines (another term from the Csound/Music N 
world). Gen routines are in charge of filling stuff into the F-tables. In 
Soundpipe, ftable creation and gen routines are two separate operations. However,
in Sporth, ftable creation and gen routine calls are a single operation.</p>
<h2>A simple example</h2>
<p>Our most basic gen routine is a sine wave generator, which computes a single
cyle of a sine wave. The code below shows how can build a 300 Hz sine wave 
using a table lookup oscillator:</p>
<pre><code> &quot;sine&quot; 4096 gen_sine
 330 0.5 0 &quot;sine&quot; osc</code></pre>
<p>A few things to take note of:</p>
<ul>
<li>"sine" is the name of the ftable. All created ftables in sporth are named</li>
<li>gen_sine is the name of the gen routine in Sporth. It is a convention in
soundpipe and sporth for gen routines to start with "gen_"</li>
<li>4096 is the size of the ftable.</li>
<li>osc takes "sine" as a parameter. </li>
</ul>
