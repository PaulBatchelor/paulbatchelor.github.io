<h1>What is Sporth?</h1>
<p>F-tables, or "function tables" are terms borrowed from the Csound 
language. Simply put, ftables are arrays of floating point values. They are
often used by audio-rate signal generators in Sporth like samplers and table-lookup
oscillators. </p>
<p>F-tables in Sporth are coupled with gen routines (another term from the Csound/Music N 
world). Gen routines are in charge of filling stuff into the F-tables. In 
Soundpipe, ftable creation and gen routines are two separate operations. However,
in Sporth, ftable creation and gen routine calls are a single operation.</p>
<h2>A simple example</h2>
<p>Our most basic gen routine is a sine wave generator, which computes a single
cyle of a sine wave. The code below shows how can build a 300 Hz sine wave 
using a table lookup oscillator:</p>
<pre><code> &quot;sine&quot; 4096 gen_sine
 330 0.5 0 &quot;sine&quot; osc</code></pre>
<p>A few things to take note of:</p>
<ul>
<li>"sine" is the name of the ftable. All created ftables in sporth are named</li>
<li>gen_sine is the name of the gen routine in Sporth. It is a convention in
soundpipe and sporth for gen routines to start with "gen_"</li>
<li>4096 is the size of the ftable.</li>
<li>osc takes "sine" as a parameter. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Gen routines with arguments</h2>
<p>Most gen routines are adopted from Csound, where arguments exist inside a 
string, separated by spaces. In Sporth/Soundpipe this convention is carried
over. The following patch uses sawtooth wavetable oscillator, whose wavetable
was generated using the gen_line gen routine. For variety, a random number
sample and hold generator is feeding into the frequency of the saw, and is
also being fed into a butterworth lowpass filter. </p>
<pre><code> &quot;saw&quot; 4096 &quot;0 1 4096 -1&quot; gen_line
 (300 800 10 randh) 0.3 0 &quot;saw&quot; osc 
 (1000 butlp)</code></pre>
<p>Gen routines conventionally follow a similar argument structure:</p>
<p>NAME SIZE ARGSTRING gen_routine</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>NAME is the name of the ftable</li>
<li>SIZE is the size of the ftable (the number of floats in the ftable)</li>
<li>ARGSTRING is the argument string parsed by the gen routine</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the argument strings, gen routines are tricky things to use
and learn about. The <a href="/res/soundpipe/docs">Soundpipe reference guide</a>,
is the most comprehensive starting point. For instance,
<a href="/res/soundpipe/docs/gen_line.html">here is the entry on gen_line</a>, the gen 
routine used in above example.</p>
<h2>The underscore (_) shortcut</h2>
<p>To save keystrokes and make ftables look prettier, the underscore key can be
used in place of strings without spaces. For instance:</p>
<pre><code> &quot;line&quot; 4096 &quot;0 1 4096 -1&quot; gen_line</code></pre>
<p>Is identical to:</p>
<pre><code> _line 4096 &quot;0 1 4096 -1&quot; gen_line</code></pre>
<p>This is the preferred convention for ftables and variables, which will be
discussed in the next chapter.</p>
