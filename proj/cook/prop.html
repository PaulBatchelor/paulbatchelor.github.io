<h1>Prop</h1>
<p>Prop is one of the microlanguaged embedded inside of Sporth. It is a 
rhythmic notation system based on proportions. </p>
<p>Prop can be used to create very complex drum machines and rhythmic profiles. </p>
<p>In Sporth, there are two ugens for prop. <strong>prop</strong> is the original ugen that compiles
a prop string and a BPM, and creates a set of <a href="gates_triggers.html">ticks</a>. 
The ugen called <strong>tprop</strong> is identical to prop, except that it has a trigger 
argument that resets prop to the beginning. </p>
