<h1>Allpass</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/allpass.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>This is an allpass filter implementation taken from the Csound opcode
<a href="http://csound.github.io/docs/manual/alpass.html">alpass</a> (note: 
spelling intentionally incorrect here.). In general, allpass filters are
unique in that they have unit-magnitude frequency response for the whole
spectrum. This particular allpass filter design is used in reverberation
design to provide colorless density. For this reason, units for this ugen 
are in seconds rather than in hertz.</p>
<p>The arguments for allpass are as follows:
<ul>
<li>revtime: is the reverberation time for the signal to decay 60dB (more 
commonly referred to as T60).</li>
<li>looptime: is the delay line length (this provides the length of the 
"echo").</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The example below shows a typical usecase for an allpass filter. Allpass 
filters are often used in series. In the example below, three sucessive
instances of allpass are created. For an input signal, an impulse is being
generated with a broadband noise signal with an exponential envelope.
The resulting sound you hear is the "impulse response", which gives you
the characteristics of the reverb.<br />  </p>
