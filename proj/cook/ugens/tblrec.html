<h1>tblrec</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/tblrec.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>Tblrec has the following arguments:
<ul>
<li>input: input signal</li>
<li>trigger: trigger signal to start/stop recording</li>
<li>table name: name of f-table to record to</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>tblrec</strong> will record an input signal to an f-table. In addition, there is 
also the ability to turn the recording off and on. When turned back on, the
pointer will rewind to the beginning, overwriting any previous data. When
the record pointer reaches the end of the table, it loops to the beginning
and continues onwards.</p>
<p>The patch below demonstrates one particular way <strong>tblrec</strong> can be used.
A simple karplus-strong instrument is recorded into a 2-second long buffer.
The buffer is then randomly shuffled through using the phase-vocoder 
mincer.</p>
<p><strong>tblrec</strong> pushes a copy of the dry signal back onto the stack.</p>
<pre><code> # create a 2-second long buffer called &quot;in&quot;
 _in sr 2 * zeros
 
 # a small plucked instrument patch
 1 metro dup 300 800 trand 0.5 100 pluck 
 
 # record the patch using tblrec. &quot;tick&quot; makes it start recording indefinitely
 tick _in tblrec 
 
 # drop the dry signal
 drop
 
 # create a jitter signal between 0 and the position of the input buffer
 0 _in tbldur (2 10 1 randh) randi 
 
 # mince it up using mincer
 1 1 2048 _in mincer
