<h1>ADSR</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/adsr.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>A gate-based ADSR envelope generator. </p>
<p>ADSR takes the following arguments:
<ul>
<li>gate signal: a steady on or off</li>
<li>attack: attack time (in seconds)</li>
<li>decay: decay time (in seconds)</li>
<li>sustain: level to sustain at (should be between 0 and 1)</li>
<li>release: release time (in seconds)
This particular ADSR algorithm is special in that it uses filters to 
generate the curved envelope signal, which is contrary to most popular ADSRs, 
which are linear. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>In the example below a toggle signal generated with the ugens <strong>dmetro</strong>
and <strong>tog</strong> are fed into <strong>adsr</strong>. This signal is then multiplied with 
a 440hz sine wave.</p>
<pre><code> 2 dmetro tog 0.1 0.1 0.9 0.8 adsr 440 0.5 sine *
