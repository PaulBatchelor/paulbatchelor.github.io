<p>[<a href="/res/cook/count.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p>A trigger-based counter. </p>
<p>It takes in the following arguments:
<ul>
<li>trig: a trigger signal</li>
<li>max: maximum value to count up to. since it is zero-index, the value 
reached is max - 1. </li>
<li>mode: this sets the counting mode. A value of 0 will loop, a value of 1
will reach the top value, then spit out "-2". </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Count will always start at 0, and count upwards towards. It is assumed that
a trigger signal will occur at the very beginning of the patch. If it does
not occur, <em>count</em> will produce a value of -1 until triggered. </p>
<p>The patch below uses count to modulate the frequency of a sine wave to
produce the overtone series.</p>
<pre><code> # Metro trigger signal
 4 metro 
 # count 0-7
 8 1 count 
 # add one to make range 1-8
 1 + 
 # multiply signal by 100 to produce harmonic series
 100 *
 # the rest of the sine
 0.3 sine
