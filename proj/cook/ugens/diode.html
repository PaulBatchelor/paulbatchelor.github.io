<h1>diode</h1>
<p>[<a href="/res/cook/diode.sp">code</a>]</p>
<p><strong>diode</strong> is a diode ladder lowpass filter, adapted from code by Will 
Pirkle. The filter design is very similar to the one used by the iconic 
TB303 bassline generator.</p>
<p>It has the following argument structure:
<ul>
<li>input: the signal to be filtered</li>
<li>freq: the cutoff frequency (in Hz)</li>
<li>resonance: the resonance amount of the filter (0-1)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The following example shows <strong>diode</strong> being used to create a subtractive
bass sound. </p>
<pre><code> # Note Sequence
 _seq &quot;0 2 3 7&quot; gen_vals
 # Create clock, duplicate, and feed into sequencer
 8 metro dup 0 _seq tseq
 # bias squence to be pitched at 2 octaves below middle C
 36 + 
 # portamento filter to add glissando, then convert to frequency
 0.01 port mtof
 # feed frequency into bandlimited sawtooth generator
 0.8 saw 
 # feed clock into envelope, and multiply with sawtooth signal
 swap 0.001 0.01 0.2 tenvx * 
 # use LFO to control cutoff frequency of diode
 0.1 1 sine 1000 8000 biscale
 # the rest of diode, with resonance cranked up
 0.9 diode
