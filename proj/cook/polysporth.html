<h1>Polysporth</h1>
<p>Polysporth is an engine for polyphony in Sporth. Bindings for polysporth are
written in the scheme dialect tinyscheme, included inside of Sporth. </p>
<h2>Why Polysporth?</h2>
<p>Sporth does a few things really well: it's simple, it's fast to write, and it's
capable of building very complex signal chains. Sporth also does a few things
quite poorly: concepts like events and notes are non-existent in Sporth, and 
polyphony is quite limited. Thus, an engine was built to enable these concepts.
Polyphonic + Sporth = Polysporth!</p>
<p>Some of the features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedded scheme language (abstractions!)</li>
<li>a voice allocation system for individual notes</li>
<li>a note scheduler</li>
<li>plugin design</li>
</ul>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Polysporth is called inside of Sporth, where a scheme file is loaded.
Inside the scheme file, different chunks of sporth code are defined called 
sporthlets. Sporthlets can be individually scheduled to be be turned on and off. </p>
<h2>More information</h2>
<p>This chapter is really a gist of Polysporth. It's still in a very
early phase. To learn more, be sure to check out the dedicated
