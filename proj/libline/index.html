<h1>libline</h1>
<p>libline is an ANSI C library for generating audio-rate line segments and curves
for computer-based music. Libline can easily interface with sample-accurate 
audio libraries like <a href="/proj/soundpipe.html">Soundpipe</a>, and a local copy is 
used inside of <a href="/proj/sporth.html">Sporth</a> via 
<a href="/proj/polysporth.html">Polysporth</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/libline">source code</a>
for libline is written using the literate programming system
known as CWEB, which can generate a full typeset PDF of the program via TeX. </p>
