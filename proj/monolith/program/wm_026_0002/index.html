<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_026_0002"></a>Signal Verification is a fancy name given for what boils
down to doing md5 checksums on in-memory buffers of
audio-rate signals. Signal verification ensures that
the outputs of a DSP algorithms are numerically identical
between platforms, refactoring, and other such changes.
</p>
<p>Such a system has been used quite succesfully for years in
the Soundpipe library and the AudioKit framework. The system
used in monolith has been adapated from the one in
Soundpipe, and modified to integrate better with Monolith.
</p>
<p>Verification in Monolith works by rendering a number of
samples of the current patchwerk patch to an allocated
buffer. Then the md5 hash is then taken of the buffer.
</p>
<p>A note that endianness is a factor. Monolith up to this
point has only been run on little-endian systems. Test
suites using signal verifcation on a little endian system
will probably break on a big endian system.
