<h3>2. Core Program Structure</h3>

<p><a id="wm_000_0014"></a>This section aims to outline the overall structure and
components of the core Monolith program. An initial sketch
can be found <a href="./img/proposed_concept.png">here.</a></p>
<br>
<p>(note: some things have changed slightly).
</p>
<p>At the root of all things is the <a href="DSP Kernel">DSP Kernel</a>. This is the
thing that computes all audio into a top-level buffer.
</p>
<p>The DSP kernel buffer is sent to the speakers in a realtime
setting using the <a href="Audio Render Thread">Audio Render Thread</a>.
</p>
<p>All DSP is done with <a href="Patchwerk and Soundpipe">Patchwerk and Soundpipe</a>.
Patchwerk is a library used to create block-based signal
chains in a modular way. DSP algorithms come from Soundpipe.
</p>
<p>Signal chains are populated using the stack-based language
<a href="Runt">Runt</a>.
</p>
<p>Monolith has a few core peripherals that can be used to
control sounds in realtime. A <a href="Virtual Interface Layer">Virtual Interface Layer</a></p>
<p>is used to separate the physical hardware components from
the DSP kernel.
</p>
<p>Hardware messages are polled and conveyed to the virtual
interface layer via the <a href="Hardware Listener">Hardware Listener</a>.
</p>
<p>The monome grid hardware is managed in
<a href="Monome Hardware and Libmonome">Monome Hardware and Libmonome</a>.
</p>
<p>The griffin knob hardware is managed in
<a href="Griffin Hardware">Griffin Hardware</a>.
</p>
<p>Hardware peripherals can be used to control sounds via
<a href="Pages">Pages</a>.
</p>
<p>Monolith largely is controlled using a <a href="Scheme">Scheme</a> REPL.
