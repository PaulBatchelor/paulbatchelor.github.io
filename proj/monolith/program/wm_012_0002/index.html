<h3>1. Line16 Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_012_0002"></a>Line16 is a special kind of sequencer for drawing
loopable line segments. It primarily utlizes the monome
grid and arc as interfaces.
</p>
<p>Line16 gets its 16 because there are a maximum of 16 points
to be used in a segment.
</p>
<p>The line16 interface breaks up the grid into 16 vertical
strips, with the buttom row reserved for global control.
</p>
<p>Each strip is a line segment point. The top button is used
to select a particular point. The 6 buttons underneath are
used to configure options specific to that point (TBD).
</p>
<p>When point is selected, the values associated with that
point will show up on the arc. The first encoder shows
the value. The second encoder shows the duration. The third
and fourth positions are aux values.
</p>
<p>All values stored for each point are normalized to be in
range 0-1. Duration is scaled internally with stored min/max
values.
</p>
<p>The line generator is designed to be played at different
playback rates.
