<h3>2. Motivation</h3>

<p><a id="wm_033_0004"></a>A blend operation such as this one is crucial for any kind
of alpha channel manipulation one might come across. The
naive approach here is to take two RGB triples and linearly
interpolate. Doing this without being careful can lead to
weird color inconsistencies, which often appear in the form
of dark shadows and muddy looking colors.
</p>
<p>The reason that this happens is because the colorspace
itself is non-linear. Monolith framebuffers implicitely use
the sRGB colorspace, which is used by default on pretty much
every electronics device. This color space adds a
non-linearity (warps) the gamma component (basically
brightness) in order to better map colors on displays.
</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to perform color mixing
operations in a linear space rather than the sRGB space.
Krita provides a pretty decent overview on the issue and
includes noticeable differences.
