<h3>27. port</h3>

<p><a id="wm_038_0124"></a><code>port</code> is a portamento filter. It is a 1-pole smoothing
filter designed to work on control signals. <code>in</code> is the
input signal, and <code>htime</code> is known as the "half-time", which
controls the smoothing amount (and can be approximately
thought of as being in units of seconds). Larger htime means
more smoothing.
