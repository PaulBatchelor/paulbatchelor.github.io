<h3>9. TODO cratewav</h3>

<p><a id="wm_007_0118"></a>The <code>cratewav</code> procedure loads a wav file from a weewiki
crate partial UUID into an ftable.
</p>
<p>A partial UUID is provided as a string. The crate is
provided as an open SQLite database handle. It is assumed
that the procedure that the crate AND the SQLar tables are
contained in this same database.
</p>
<p>This procedure works first by extracting the filename from
the UUID. The filename can then be used to load things
from the blob in the SQLar table to an ftable via
<code>sqlar_loadwav</code> (not included here).
