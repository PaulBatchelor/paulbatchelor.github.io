<h3>1. Introduction/Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_024_0002"></a>This an implementation of a so-called trigger delay. Kind of
similar to something like a MIDI delay, only a lot more
rudimentary.
</p>
<p>A trigger goes in, and it gets delayed by a certain period
of time with feedback. This trigger can then be fed into
other modules to trigger other events. That's the gist of
it, at least.
