<h3>1. Step Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_011_0002"></a><b>Step</b> is a monophonic step sequencer, designed to be primarily controlled
with the 16x8 monome grid controller.
</p>

<h4>1.1. Output Signal</h4>

<p><a id="wm_011_0004"></a>This is a sequencer designed to be used in a digital modular setting. Unlike
most sequencers, this one output audio-rate signals, not events (like MIDI).
</p>
<p>There are three signals that this sequencer outputs: a note signal, a gate
signal, and a trigger signal. The note signal is the pitch value (as a
MIDI note value). The gate signal is a on/off signal that indicates if
the note is on or not. The trigger signal that indicates the beginning
of the note. These signal can be used to articulate a signal generator.
</p>

<h4>1.2. Layout</h4>

<p><a id="wm_011_0006"></a>Step splits the monome into 2 4x16 sections. The top section is the
<b>display section</b>. The bottom section is the <b>control section</b>.
</p>

<h5>1.2.1. Display Section</h5>

<p><a id="wm_011_0008"></a>The display section is used to visualize and partially edit the
current sequence. The display visualizes both playhead position and
gate. To do this, the section is divded into two 2x14 sections. The first
2x14 section displays beats 1-16, and the second section displays beats 17-32.
A section has two rows: the top row visualizes the playhead position, and the
bottom row visualizes the gate signal.
</p>
<p>The playhead is visible in exactly one place at any given time.
</p>

<h5>1.2.2. Control Section</h5>

<p><a id="wm_011_0010"></a>The control section is where most of the steq sequencing and programming will
happen. It has four distinct rows.
</p>
<p>The first row is used to edit the note number. From left to right, the first
12 buttons are used to display the semitone position (from C to C). The
last 4 buttons are used to visualize the octave (-12, 0, 12, 24).
</p>
<p>The fourth row is a control pannel. Each button is treated individually to
do things like playback control.
</p>
<p>The second and third rows have yet to be defined at the time of writing.
