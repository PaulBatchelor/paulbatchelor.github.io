<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_027_0002"></a>In this document, we will outline and implement a data
structure that will be known as an ftable list. In addition,
a simple ftable sequencer known will be built to demonstrate
the musical possibilities that the ftable list will provide.
</p>
<p>The ftable list is a dynamically expanding array of ftable
pointer locations. They are created via appending created
ftables to the list.
</p>
<p>Ftable lists can be an ideal way to dynamically switch
between ftables while a patch is running.
</p>
<p>As a simple use case for an ftable list would be an ftable
sequencer. Such an item would take in a clock signal and
a ftable list, and then synthesizes an ouput ftable. Every
time the clock triggers, it goes to the next item in the
ftable list, and copies the data and length over into
the output ftable. This ftable could then treated and read
like any normal ftable.
</p>
<p>The big downside with the implementation is that it only
works with block-rate clocks, or clock signals that only
trigger at the beginning of blocks. To compensate for this,
some thought about the trigger signal may have to be
considered.
