<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p><a id="wm_029_0002"></a>This document implements <code>monolith_fbm</code>, a seed for
a stateless fractional brownian motion algorithm.
</p>
<p><code>monolith_fbm</code> takes in an xy coordinate pair, expected to
be normalized in range 0-1, as well as the number of
octaves. It will return a normalized amplitude. <code>fbm</code> calls
can be mixed and matched together and warped with time
to create 2-dimensional swirls of color.
</p>
<p>This FBM algorithm is based on some of code snippets
found in <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/13/">the book of shaders</a>,
except instead of shader code on the GPU, it's C code
on the CPU.
