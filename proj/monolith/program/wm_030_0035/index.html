<h3>4. The Dither Algorithm</h3>

<p><a id="wm_030_0035"></a>The actual dither algorithm itself. There's some great
places to learn about dither, including the blog post I
linked at the top of this document. These are good places
to get a thorough overview of the topic, not here.
</p>
<p>Dithering is a matter of taking each pixel and approximating
it to the nearest color. If a pixel is kinda light, make it
white. If it's kinda dark, make it black. For our filter,
these two colors are referred to as light and dark.
</p>
<p>Two dimensional dither works by taking the error (how much
it snapped to the color), and distributing it to the
surrounding pixels, in a process known as <b>error diffusion</b>.
How this error is divied up and distrubuted determines the
diffusion algorithm.
</p>
<p>Atkinson dithering works by taking the error, dividing it by
8, and then distributing that value amongst 6 surrounding
pixels: two pixels down, two pixels forward, one pixel down
to the left, and one pixel down to the right. It helps to
draw a picture (the blog post I used had an excellent one).
</p>
<p>The full error does not get distributed. Apparently, this
sort of technique is known to provide a "reduced color
bleed", reducing speckling artifacts, but causing contiguous
light/dark regions to be more pronounced.
</p>
<p>And that's it in a nutshell. To implement the error
distribution, three row buffers were used: the first
row is used to store errors for the current row, the
second for the next row, the third for the row after
that. At the end of every row, the row buffers rotate
up in position, causing the first row to be the new
third row. While in in the first row, the buffer gets
zero'd out as it goes left-to-right, causing it to be
fully re-initialized by the time the rotation happens.
