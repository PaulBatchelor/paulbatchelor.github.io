<h3>4. Crossfading</h3>

<p><a id="wm_016_0026"></a>Up next are the slightly non-trivial bits of this program.
Overall read position is kept track of. While this
position is in the fade region, the file is read from
the beginning and simultaneously. This requires an
extra buffer, and a way to jump back and forth between
positions in the files.
</p>
<p>If it happens that the read position is still in the
fade region, the file will seek to the outfile end position
plus the read position as an offset, and fill up a buffer
that is COUNT samples long.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;read_end&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>drwav_seek_to_sample(&infile, endpos + pos);
count = drwav_read_f32(&infile, BUFSIZE, endbuf);
&lt;&lt;snap_it_back&gt;&gt;</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This buffer will then be scaled and summed into the output
buffer.
</p>
<p>Scaling is done using a normalized alpha value, which is
the current sample position, divided by the fade time.
The end block gets multiplied by alpha. Beginning block
is one minus alpha.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;scale_and_sum&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>float beg, end;
float a;
beg = buf[n];
end = endbuf[n];
a = (float)pos / fade;
buf[n] = (1 - a) * end + a * beg;</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>With the end read done, the file can jump back to the
previous position and go COUNT samples further, in order
to get ready for the next read.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;snap_it_back&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>drwav_seek_to_sample(&infile, pos + count);</pre></code>
