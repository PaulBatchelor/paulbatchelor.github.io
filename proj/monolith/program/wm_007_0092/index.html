<h3>9. TODO sqlite_open</h3>

<p><a id="wm_007_0092"></a>The <code>sqlite_open</code> operation allows a sqlite handle to be
opened and managed inside of a patchwerk patch.
</p>
<p>This is primarily intended to be used with SQLar, but
since opening SQLar archives is just open a SQLite database,
figured I might as well generalize this baby.
</p>

<h4>9.1. TODO monolith_sqlite_open</h4>

<p><a id="wm_007_0094"></a>The lowest level function for this is
<code>monolith_sqlite_open</code> as a C function. Provided is the
patchwerk patch, as well the filename.
</p>
<p>This will attempt to open and store a SQLite database
filehandle, and will return an error when it is not found.
</p>
<p>The SQLite handle is appended as a patchwerk pointer, with
a destroy function that will close the SQLite handle. Like
all patchwerk pointers, this gets called when the patch is
destroyed.
</p>

<h4>9.2. TODO sqlite_open in runt</h4>

<p><a id="wm_007_0096"></a></p>

<h5>9.2.1. Word</h5>

<p><a id="wm_007_0097"></a>the <code>sqlite_open</code> runt word wraps <code>monolith_sqlite_open</code>
inside of a struct.
</p>

<h5>9.2.2. Wrappers for getting/pushing sqlite</h5>

<p><a id="wm_007_0099"></a>Runt has a dumb type system, which can be used to add a
thin layer of confidence that the C data you are
hucking is in fact a sqlite database handle, and not
something like I don't know an ftable?
</p>
<p>Speaking of tables, the structure of these is based on the
ftable wrappers found in the patchwerk codebase (the author
is going over there right now...)
</p>
<p><code>rpw_get_sqlite</code> will pop a SQLite database off the stack.
If that item is not a SQLite database, then it will throw
an error.
</p>
<p><code>rpw_stacklet_sqlite</code> will configure a runt stacklet to hold
a sqlite database handle. The ID will be set to be
<code>END + 5717</code>, where <code>END</code> is the end value from
<code>rpw_get_end</code>. The value 5717 is a number derived from
taking the base64 value "sql" (0xb2a9), and right-shifting
3: <code>base64("sql")>>3</code></p>
