<h1>Registers</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Registers are a thing that's part of Runt. Basically, it's
a global array of <code>runt_stacklet</code> types. Using this, one
is able to push stuff on to the stack, pop it off, and store
it indefinitely until it is written again.
</p>
<p>The number of registers that runt has is defined by the compile
time-macro <code>RUNT_REGISTER_SIZE</code>. By default, this value
is 16. If you need to change this, you must recompile runt,
not just the macro.
</p>

<h2>regget/regset</h2>

<p><code>regget</code> and <code>regset</code> are used to store and retrieve items
in the registers.
</p>

<h2>cabget/cabset</h2>

<p><code>cabget</code> and <code>cabset</code> are specialized versions of <code>regget</code>and <code>regset</code>, used to store held graforge <a href="/proj/monolith/wiki/cables">cables</a>.

<h2>dynamic cable generation with mkcab</h2>

<p>Keeping track of registers for cables can be tedious
work. Luckily, there is an operation which automates
this a little bit.
</p>
<p>The scheme function <code>monolith:mkcab</code> can be used
to store and hold a signal. It will return a
register number that can be used with <code>cabget</code>,
and then cleared with <code>cabclr</code> when it is finished.
</p>
<p>The first argument is a lambda for the signal,
and the second argument is the suggested starting
register. The function works by going through each
</p>
<p>In the example below, a single oscillator using phase
distortion synthesis is modulated with a LFO signal
stored in register <code>lfo</code>. <code>let*</code> is ideal to use because
it allows <code>mkcab</code> to sequentially set values.
</p>
<pre><code>(define (phasedist-voice)
  (gen_sine (ftnew 8192))
  (regset zz 0)
  (let* ((note 58)
         (ft (lambda () (regget 0)))
         (lfo (monolith:mkcab
               (lambda ()
                 (biscale (oscf (/ 1 28) 0 ft) 0 1)) 0)))
    (phasor (mtof
             (add
               (mul
                 (oscf (scale (cabget lfo) 4 6) 0 ft)
                 (scale (cabget lfo) 0 0.3)) note)) 0)
    (pdhalf zz (scale (cabget lfo) 0 0.8))
    (oscfext zz ft)
    (mul zz 0.3)
    (cabclr lfo))
    (out zz))</pre></code>
