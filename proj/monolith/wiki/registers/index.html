<h1>Registers</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Registers are a thing that's part of Runt. Basically, it's
a global array of <code>runt_stacklet</code> types. Using this, one
is able to push stuff on to the stack, pop it off, and store
it indefinitely until it is written again.
</p>
<p>The number of registers that runt has is defined by the compile
time-macro <code>RUNT_REGISTER_SIZE</code>. By default, this value
is 16. If you need to change this, you must recompile runt,
not just the macro.
