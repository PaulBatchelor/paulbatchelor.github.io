<h1>How to handle "Buffer Pool Full" error</h1>
<p>Monolith will squawk a "Buffer Pool Full" error
when all the pools in the buffer pool are used up
in the current patch. This can happen with large
patches or when making heavy use of things like
<code>cabtmp</code> and holding cables (see <a href="/proj/monolith/wiki/cables">cables</a>).
</p>
<p>When this error happens it is shuts down patchwerk
on a global scale, which makes it tricky to recover
from.
</p>
<p>Patchwerk (and therefore monolith) will not move until
the global error flag has been reset.
</p>
<p>Here is how you do it.
</p>
<p>First, correct your patch but DO NOT RE-EVALUATE. The usual
culprit is holding too many cables. The easiest thing to do
is use <code>cabnew</code> instead of <code>cabtmp</code>, which will explicitely
allocate a new buffer.
</p>
<p>Next, reset the error flag. In scheme this is done with
<code>(monolith:reset-err)</code>.
</p>
<p>Free all the buffers being held in scheme with <code>(bunholdall)</code>.
</p>
<p>Clear all the runt registers with <code>(regclrall)</code>.
</p>
<p>Zero out monolith with <code>(out 0)</code>.
</p>
<p>Recompile the patch.
