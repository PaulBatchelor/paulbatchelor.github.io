<h1>Starting up Monolith</h1>
<p>This is the workflow I use to start up Monolith.
</p>
<p>Start up emacs, open up an ansi-term (this I have mapped to
a keyboard shortcut).
</p>
<p>Go to the monolith folder and start jack. (I have a "run_jack"
script included with this repo that's configured to work
with my USB audio DAC).
</p>
<p>Open up setup.el.
</p>
<p>M-x load-file, then hit enter twice.
</p>
<p>While in the setup.el buffer, hit s-q. This should start the
s9 scheme REPL with monolith in it. Use this shortcut to
jump to the REPL.
</p>
<p>Run some commands:
</p>
<pre><code>(monolith:load "ugens.scm")
(monolith:start)
(out (sine 440 0.1))</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>With any luck, some sound.
