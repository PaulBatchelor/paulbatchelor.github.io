<title>State Files in Monolith</title>
<h1>State Files in Monolith</h1>
<p>Monolith is able to save/load data in what is
known as a "state file". State files were initial created as
a way for Pages to have persistent data. When a page gets
saved/loaded, a state file is used. State files are designed
to be used for many pages at once. It is expected that one
state file is used for an entire patch (or patches) created
in Monolith.
</p>
<p>A state file is mostly used to read/write Page data. The way
this happens is this: a state file is opened, page
save/load operations happen, then the state file is closed.
</p>
<p>A state file is opened with <code>monolith:state-open</code> in Scheme,
and <code>monolith/state-open</code> in Janet. There can be only one
state opened at a time.
</p>
<p>A state file is closed with <code>monolith:state-close</code> in
Scheme, or <code>monolith/state-close</code> in Janet.
</p>
<p>The file format of state file is a SQLite database. Every
page has it's own table with a custom schema. It is not
uncommon for pages to blobs of data in the msgpack
serialization format. For encoding/decoding msgpack data,
an embedded version of the cmp library is used.
</p>
<p>The version of Janet that is included in Monolith has
both bindings for SQLite, as well as routines for decoding
msgpack blobs stored (via cmp).
</p>
<p>This janet code below opens a state file "state.db", and
reads the sequence data from some seq16 data save as
"sequence".
</p>
<p>The function <code>monolith/msgpack-read</code> will parse a janet
buffer with msgpack data, and then return a Janet data
structure.
</p>
<pre><code>(defn parse-steps (buf)
  (monolith/msgpack-read buf))

(def db (sqlite3/open "state.db"))

(def rows
  (sqlite3/eval
   db
   "SELECT steps from seq16 where key is \"sequence\";"))

(pp (parse-steps ((rows 0) "steps")))

(sqlite3/close db)</pre></code>
