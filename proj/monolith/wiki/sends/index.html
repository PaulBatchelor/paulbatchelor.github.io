<h1>Effect Sends</h1>

<h2>What Are Sends?</h2>

<p>A <code>send</code> in monolith is pretty much what a send would be in
your typical DAW. It's a thing that allows you to send one
or more audio signals to some sort of audio effect to be
processed. Common examples of this include a reverb and
delay.
</p>
<p>The gist of making a send in monolith involves making a
send cable, writing stuff to that send cable, then sending
the output of that cable to some kind of audio processor.
</p>

<h2>The Nitty Gritty Bits</h2>

<p>Usually sending is done with scheme code, which calls runt
code, which makes calls to patchwerk C library.
</p>
<p>At the patchwerk level, a send is a cable containing an
audio buffer that gets thrown around a patch after it
has been created.
</p>
<p>The "send" aspect is the unique part of all this. When
a signal gets sent to the send cable, it's really taking
the buffer contents of the signal, and adding it the
contents of send cable buffer. The send amount attenuates
the signal being copied.
</p>
<p>By the time, the send cable reaches the processor, the
buffer contains the sum of all signals ready to be
processed.
</p>
<p>When the patch goes around again to compute another block of
audio, the send cable buffer is zeroed out before anything
is written to it, and the process begins again.
</p>

<h2>Example: A reverb Send</h2>

<p>Say you want to make a reverb send.
</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is create a send cable, and
save it to a register. A new cable can be created with
<code>cabtmp</code>. <code>cabtmp</code> creates a cable with a buffer. to prevent
buffers from being overwritten, they must be held with
<code>bhold</code> (if the buffer is not from the pool, this will be
ignored). <code>cabset</code> stores the cable in the register
<code>REG-REV</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>(define REG-REV 0)
(define (rev-init)
  (cabset (bhold (cabtmp (const 0))) (param REG-REV)))</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Throw a signal with <code>rev-throw</code>. This function will pop
the last signal on the stack and mix it into the send
cable.
</p>
<p>The actual sending is done with a thing called <code>cthrow</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>(define (rev-throw amt)
  (cthrow
   zz
   (amt)
   (lambda () (cabget REG-REV))))</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, process the values from the send cable, and clear
the send cable. Cables <b>must</b> be cleared with <code>cabclr</code>,
otherwise buffers from the buffer pools will be unable
to be reclaimed. <code>cabclr</code> is mixes the behavior of <code>cabget</code>and <code>bunhold</code>. It expects a register ID where the cable is,
and not the cable itself.
</p>
<pre><code>(define (rev-process)
  (cabget REG-REV)
  (cabget REG-REV)
  (revsc zz zz (param 0.95) (param 10000))
  (bdrop)
  (dcblock zz)
  (mul zz 0.5)
  (cabclr REG-REV))</pre></code>

<h2>Automatically making send cables with mkcab</h2>

<p>The scheme function <code>monolith:mkcab</code> can be used
to create a cable and assign it to a free
<a href="#">register</a>.
</p>
<p>The following can be used to create an initial cable
and store the register address to a <code>REV-CAB</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>(set! REV-CAB (monolith:mkcab (lambda () (const 0)) 0)))</pre></code>
