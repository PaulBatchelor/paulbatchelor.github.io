<h1>Norns</h1>
<p>Monolith + Norns.
</p>
<p>Broad strokes for now.
</p>
<p>First, establish a cross compiler using the buildroot norns
image. The repo for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/simonvanderveldt/norns-image">here</a></p>
<br>
<p>Ideally, the cross compiler should be visible in the <code>PATHS</code>
variable.
</p>
<p>After that, certain dependencies need to be manually built.
This includes: soundpipe, runt, patchwerk, SQLite3.
</p>
<p>After those have been built, monolith can be built. Monolith
supplies a special config file called <code>config-norns.mk</code>.
</p>
<p>Use it with:
</p>
<pre><code>export CONFIG=config-norns.mk</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Then run <code>make</code>. With any luck, it should build.
</p>
<p>The monolith binary can then be transferred to the norns. If
the scheme interpreter is to be used, <code>s9.scm</code> must be
transferred as well.
</p>
<p>Janet is the preferred language to use on the norns, but
it is possible to use scheme as well. The scheme image must
be generated first. Make sure <code>s9.scm</code> is copied over and
in the same directory as the <code>monolith</code> binary. Then, run
<code>monolith mkimg</code>. This should generate a file called
<code>monolith.image</code>. A scheme REPL should then appear when you
run <code>monolith</code> without any arguments.
