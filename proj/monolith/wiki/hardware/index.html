<title>Hardware Integration</title>
<h1>Hardware Integration</h1>
<p>Monolith is tightly integrated around particular bits of
hardware. (Sometimes, it's a bit too tight!)
</p>
<p>Primary interfaces include the <code>Grid</code> and the <code>Arc</code> by
<code>Monome</code>, and the <code>Griffin Powermate</code>
USB multimedia knob controller.
</p>
<p>Secondary interfaces include things like the <code>G430</code> Graphics
Tablet. These are way more optional then the primary
interfaces, and often require more manual configuration from
within Monolith. More information can be found in
<a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_3260#wm_000_3260">21. The G430 Interface</a>.
</p>
<p>Monolith hardware is controlled using <code>libmonome</code>, bypassing
OSC and serialosc completly. More information on how this
works can be found in <a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1825#wm_000_1825">13. Monome Hardware (Arc, Grid) and Libmonome</a>.
</p>
<p>The <code>Griffin</code> HID events are controlled using a very handy
library called <code>hidapi</code>, which is a small layer on top of
<code>libusb</code>. A local copy of hidapi is found locally in the
source code for Linux. On OSX, it can be installed via
homebrew. More information on parsing can be found in
<a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_2044#wm_000_2044">14. Griffin Hardware</a>.
</p>
<p>All event polling for all hardware happens in a single
thread known internally the <code>Hardware Listener</code>. Keeping all
the polling in one thread (as opposed using one thread for
each polling interface) keeps things simple, and makes
debugging easier. So far, it has yet to be a problem. More
information on this can be found in <a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1750#wm_000_1750">12. Hardware Listener</a>.
</p>
<p>For primary hardware interfaces, a thin abstraction layer
is placed between the actual hardware and Monolith. This
is done in the hopes that someday Monolith can be controlled
by virtual hardware devices for individuals who do not own
the real things. More information on this
<code>virtual interface layer</code> can be found in
<a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_0557#wm_000_0557">8. Virtual Interface Layer</a>.
</p>
<p>When compiled for the <code>norns</code>, Monolith also polls the
onboard knobs and buttons inside the main hardware listener.
More information on this can be found in <a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_2163#wm_000_2246">17.3. Monolith Norns Event Polling</a>.
