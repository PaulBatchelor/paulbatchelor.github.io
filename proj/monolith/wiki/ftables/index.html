<h1>FTables</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><code>ftables</code>, or Function Tables, is a term borrowed from MUSIC N
and the Csound, used to describe fixed-lenth floating point
tables, often used by things like table lookup oscillators.
Presumably, the "function" aspect may come from the fact that
these tables were often allocated then put through a
function to do things like generate sine waves.
</p>
<p>Ftables are a data structure defined in Soundpipe, and are
often abbreviated as <code>ftbl</code> in code, and in C have the struct
name <code>sp_ftbl</code>.
</p>

<h3>GEN Routines</h3>

<p>GEN routines are another throwback term found in MUSIC N and
Csound. These are things that take in csound
</p>

<h3>TODO Making Ftables</h3>


<h3>TODO Gen routines</h3>

<p><code>gen_sine</code> <code>loadwav</code>, etc.
</p>

<h3>TODO UGens that take ftables</h3>

<p><code>oscf</code>, <code>osci</code>, <code>fosc</code>, <code>fmpair</code>, <code>tabread</code>, <code>trd</code>, etc.
</p>

<h3>Getting ftable size/duration</h3>

<p>The runt words <code>tblsize</code> and <code>tbldur</code> get
size and duration, respectively.
</p>
<p><code>tblsize</code> returns the length of the ftable in
samples, while <code>tbldur</code> returns the length
of the ftable in seconds.
