<h1>Runt</h1>
<p>Runt is a stack-based glue language used with monolith.
Similar to Forth, Runt implements a global stack and
dictionary. User-defined procedures are technically
possible, but are virtually unused in the context of
Monolith.
</p>
<p>Runt is used on top of the <a href="#">patchwerk</a> C API
to create a stack-based audio language very similar
to Sporth, the author's project before Monolith.
</p>
<p>Both Patchwerk and Monolith add hundreds of words to Runt's
dictionary. Most of these are unit-generators, or
<a href="/proj/monolith/wiki/ugens">ugens</a>, which are patchwerk nodes wrapped inside
of a Runt word defined in C.
</p>
<p>In practice, runt code is usually evaluated from inside of
a <a href="#">scheme</a> REPL.
