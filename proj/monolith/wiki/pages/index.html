<h1>Pages</h1>

<h2>What are pages?</h2>

<p>In Monolith, <code>pages</code> are special interactive interfaces.
They are specifically designed so that multiple monome-y
apps can exist at once.
</p>
<p>Only one page can be actively selected at a time.
When a page is selected, they are able access to the
hardware peripherals like the monome arc and grid.
</p>
<p>Pages are referred to as unique names.
</p>

<h2>Creating a page</h2>

<p>Every page has their own custom page creator. Usually
it takes the form <code>monolith:FOO-new</code>, and it takes in
the name as an argument. For instance, to create a new
grid page:
</p>
<pre><code>(monolith:grid-new "g")</pre></code>

<h2>Selecting a page</h2>

<p>Any page can be selected with <code>monolith:page-select</code>.
</p>
<p>For instance, to select a page called "g":
</p>
<pre><code>(monolith:page-select "g")</pre></code>

<h2>Loading/Saving Pages</h2>

<p>Pages are loaded/saved with the use of what are known
as <code>state files</code>. State files need to be loaded with
<code>monolith:state-open</code> before any load/save operations
happen. After, the state can be closed with
<code>monolith/state-close</code>.
</p>
<p>Pages are referenced with a unique name known as a "key".
These need to be unique. It is not possible, for instance,
to have two grid pages with the key "grid". It is, however,
possible (but not advised) to have two pages of different
types with the same name.
</p>

<h3>Saving a single page</h3>

<p>Pages can be saved to a state file with
<code>monolith:page-save</code>. It takes in two arguments: the
name of the page, and then the key of the page to save it
as. The key should be unique.
</p>
<p>This example below attempts to save the current state of
page "g" into a state file with the key "gridstate".
</p>
<pre><code>(monolith:state-open "state.db")
(monolith:page-save "g" "gridstate")
(monolith:state-close)</pre></code>

<h3>Loading a single page</h3>

<p>Page data can be loaded using <code>monolith:page-load</code>. These
take in the same ordered arguments as <code>monolith:page-save</code>:
the page name (as it is seen in monolith), and the key as
stored in the state file. Both the key and the page name
need to exist for this to work.
</p>
<p>This example below attempts to load the data stored
in "gridstate" into the page named "g".
</p>
<pre><code>(monolith:state-open "state.db")
(monolith:page-load "g" "gridstate")
(monolith:state-close)</pre></code>

<h3>Loading/Saving Many Pages</h3>

<p>Use <code>monolith:save-pages</code> to save many pages at once.
This will preprend each page with a prefix in an attempt
to prevent name collisions.
</p>
<pre><code>(monolith:state-open "state.db")
(monolith:save-pages "test-patch" (list "grid" "seq"))
(monolith:state-close)</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>A similar process for loading is done with
<code>monolith:load-pages</code>. This makes the assumption that the
same prefix is used, and that the pages have been created
beforehand.
</p>
<pre><code>(monolith:state-open "state.db")
(monolith:load-pages "test-patch" (list "grid" "seq"))
(monolith:state-close)</pre></code>

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>The underlying source code for pages can be found in
the main monolith code in the section <a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1157#wm_000_1157">11. Pages</a>.
