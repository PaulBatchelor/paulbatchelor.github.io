<title>The Monolith Dictionary</title>
<h1>The Monolith Dictionary</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The monolith <code>dictionary</code> is an internal <code>hashmap</code> used
to store and retrieve data. Usually this is
used for <a href="/proj/monolith/wiki/pages">pages</a>, but it has been extended
to be used for other data like <a href="/proj/monolith/wiki/ftables">ftables</a>, and
images.
</p>
<p>This page aims to provide an overview of how this dictionary
works under the hood, with links to the appropriate sections
in the source code.
</p>
<p>Main section on the dictionary can be found here:
<a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1226#wm_000_1263">11.3. Page Dictionary (included in top-level struct)</a></p>

<h2>Pages Vs Entries</h2>

<p>In Monolith, <a href="/proj/monolith/wiki/pages">pages</a> have a specific meaning
and refer to a specific interface abstraction. <code>Entries</code>refer to the items that can be added to a dictionary.
</p>
<p>At one point, pages were the only thing that could be
added to dictionaries, as that was the original purpose for
building the dictionary in the first place.
For this reason there is a heavy emphasis on pages
in the structure; Some older parts
of the program may still refer to entries as pages.
</p>

<h2>Adding new entries to the dictionary</h2>

<p>A new Monolith Page can be added to the dictionary with
<code>monolith_dict_newpage</code>:
<a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1226#wm_000_1427">11.3.10. Page Entry Creation</a></p>
<p>Create a generic dictionary entry with <code>monolith_dict_newentry</code>.
This was extracted from <code>monolith_dict_newpage</code> in a
refactoring effort.
<a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1226#wm_000_1434">11.3.11. Generic Entry Creation</a></p>

<h2>Dictionary Find and Lookup</h2>

<p>Here we get into confusing terminology: <code>find</code>and <code>lookup</code> mean different things.
</p>
<p><code>monolith_dict_find</code> is used to retrieve generic entries
from a dictionary given a keyword. <a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1226#wm_000_1277">11.3.2. Entry Find</a>.
</p>
<p>The function <code>monolith_dict_lookup</code> is used specifically
to find a monolith page: <a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1226#wm_000_1264">11.3.1. Entry Page Lookup</a>. This was the original way to retrieve
data from a dictionary before generic entries were
introduced.
</p>

<h2>Managing Data inside of an Entry</h2>

<p>An entry is defined as a struct called
<code>monolith_dict_entry</code>. Inside of this struct is a generic
pointer called <code>ud</code>, where one can store data.
<a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1226#wm_000_1283">11.3.3. Entry Struct</a>. The monolith
page (<a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1226#wm_000_1442">11.4. Page Struct Declaration</a>),
for example, stores it's data using this <code>ud</code> value.
</p>
<p>User Data in the entry is cleaned up when the list it
belongs to gets freed via <code>monolith_dict_entrylist_free</code>:
<a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_1226#wm_000_1329">11.3.4.3. Entry List Cleanup</a>. At
the moment, specific types are hard-coded to have different
behaviors of freeing data. In the future, the hope is
to have a more general purpose interface.
