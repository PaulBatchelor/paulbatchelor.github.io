<h3>19. Some Initial Thoughts on Graphics</h3>

<p><a id="wm_000_2860"></a>It is admittedly a nice thing when sound can bleed into the
visual domain.
</p>
<p>Graphics exist in Monolith in a very limited capacity by
design.
</p>
<p>Graphics can be a big distraction and
dilute focus. It is far too easy to get sucked into making
things that "look" good instead of making things that sound
good. And sound really is the the thing to be doing here.
</p>
<p>What are some limitations imposed? To begin, portable
CPU-based raster graphics. No shaders and the like. Very
limited resolutions as well, the likes have which haven't
been seen since the 90s.
