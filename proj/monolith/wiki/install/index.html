<title>Installing Monolith</title>
<h1>Installing Monolith</h1>

<h2>A Friendly Warning</h2>

<p>Monolith is mostly a project I built for myself for my
needs. Installation is a little bit quirky. Some parts
(such as the monome hardware integration, literally
hard-coded to my details).
</p>
<p>I've ensured that Monolith compiles on both Linux
and OSX. It's not exactly streamlined, but the process
does work pretty consistently. You will have to compile
a few small projects of mine from source. Those who
do not have the patience for this may want to consider
<a href="/sndkit">sndkit</a>, which is a one-stop-shop
sort of deal.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>


<h3>Mandatory</h3>

<p>A C development environment (gcc/clang, Make, etc)
</p>
<p>The <a href="/proj/worgle">Worgle</a> tangler, found on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pbatch/worgle">sourcehut</a>.
</p>
<p>SQLite (libsqlite-dev or equivalent).
</p>
<p>The <a href="/proj/soundpipe.html">soundpipe</a> DSP library, found on
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pbatch/sourcehut">sourcehut</a>.
</p>
<p>The <a href="/proj/runt">runt</a> scripting language, found on
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pbatch/runt">sourcehut</a>.
</p>
<p>The <a href="/proj/graforge">runt-graforge</a> audio graph library. Note
that this will need ctangle, which is part of cweb.
This should be installed on most computers that have TeX
installed. If not, a self-contained version can be found on
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~pbatch/cweb">sourcehut</a>. The runt-graforge
stuff can be found in the 'runt' project.
</p>

<h3>Optional</h3>

<p>These are optional dependencies:
</p>
<p>JACK, for realtime audio.
</p>
<p>libx264, for video encoding.
</p>
<p>libmonome, for monome use.
</p>

<h2>"Simple Mode" Install</h2>

<p>Simple mode is a version of monolith that tries
to minimize dependencies and is offline rendering only.
It does away with libmonome, JACK, and libx264.
</p>
<p>You'll still need core libraries and tools made by
the author (worgle, soundpipe, runt, graforge), and
SQLite as well.
</p>
<p>To enable simple mode, add
</p>
<pre><code>MONOLITH_SIMPLE=1</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>To the end of <code>config.mk</code>.
</p>
<p>Make sure monolith is fully cleaned with <code>make clean</code>,
then run <code>make</code>.
</p>
<p>When it is done compiling, make a file in the same directory
called <code>test.scm</code>, and put this in it:
</p>
<pre><code>(monolith:start-offline)
(monolith:load "ugens.scm")
(randh 200 500 10)
(sine zz 0.3)
(wavout zz "test.wav")
(out zz)
(monolith:compute (* 44100 10))</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Then run:
</p>
<pre><code>./monolith -l p/monolith.scm test.scm</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>With any luck, a file called <code>test.wav</code> should appear.
