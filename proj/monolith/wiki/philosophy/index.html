<h1>Philosophy</h1>
<p>Some of the driving forces behind Monolith.
</p>
<p>Let's start with the name. Some things come to mind. That
black thing from 2001 space odyssey, perhaps?
</p>
<p>The term "monolithic" comes to mind next. This term gets
used a bit in the context of software engineering. This
is indeed a monolithic repository of stuff. Instead of
managing a bunch of little projects, I get them all to play
together in one place.
</p>
<p>I. Me. Mono. Singular. This is a project I built for myself.
Artists have built their own tools for centuries. I try to
capture that spirit by writing music software that I compose
with. I don't expect others to really use this day to day.
I do hope that people perhaps try it out and use components
from this project for their own beautiful sound-making
ecosystems.
</p>
<p>Monolith, while centralized, also tries to
be decoupled. Over time, I try to make it to decompose
and have components be re-used and re-purposed for other
projects. Environmentally friendly design call this "second
life recycling". Usually applied to physical stuff, but it
applies just fine to software too.
</p>
<p>When you build music software from scratch, you will
re-invent a lot of wheels. This provides the opportunity to
question everything you thought you knew about
computer-based workflows.
</p>
<p>In truth, the name "Monolith" was so-named because it was
originally to be integrated with the monome grid (formerly
just reffered as the "monome"). It is the second iteration
of it's kind. The first was an interactive graphical text
editor called "monomer". This largely failed because making
a useful text editor is hard.
