<h1>Hotswapping</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The process of <code>hotswapping</code> in this context refers to
method used to update patches on-the-fly.
</p>
<p>The way it works: there are two subpatches. One subpatch is
the one that is running, the other is the one that can be
appended to and built up. When that patch is finished, it
sends a signal to the audio rendering thread that it is
ready to be swapped. The audio rendering thread gets the
message, and swaps the subpatches. The subpatch previously
running gets reset and becomes the subpatch to write to,
and the other patch now becomes the running patch.
</p>

<h2>Crossfading</h2>

<p>With this approach, crossfading is also possible.
Crossfading is ideal for hotswapping because to some extent
it can prevent audible clicks from occuring. The trick here
is to use a counter and defer resetting the old subpatch
for the duration of the counter. During this time, both the
old and new subpatches are computed, and mixed together
based on the counter position and crossfade time.
</p>
<p>The hotswapping technique forms the basis for what we would
consider as a livecoding environment for music.
</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The working implementation for hotswapping can be found in
Monolith <a href="/proj/monolith/program/wm_000_0221#wm_000_0270">5.2. Hot Swapping</a>. This implementation
has a few small constructs on top of patchwerk, and should
be relatively portable.
</p>
<p>Monolith uses the <code>monolith_cable</code> type for hotswapping, one
for reading a patch (the one you hear), and the other for
writing (the one "on deck"). Each monolith has a subpatch
containing the audio graph, it's own allocated audio buffer
for an audio signal. The output cable takes in an input
signal and copies it to the local buffer.
