<h1>Moons</h1>
<p><img src="/res/moons/moons_sm.png" alt="Small screenshot of Moons in action" /></p>
<p><em>Moons</em> is an isorhythmic circular sequencer. It is written using a combination of C and C++.
All visuals are created using OpenGl; All the sounds are snythesized in realtime
using <a href="/proj/sporth.html">Sporth</a>, <a href="/proj/soundpipe.html">Soundpipe</a>, and RTaudio.</p>
<h2>Compilation/Installation</h2>
<p>The latest version of Moons can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/PaulBatchelor/Moons">github</a>.</p>
<p>Moons requires libsporth (<a href="http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/sporth.git">github</a>) 
and the <strong>dev branch</strong> of libsoundpipe 
(<a href="http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/soundpipe.git">github</a>). On Linux, JACK and
the development libraries will also need to be installed.</p>
<p>After these have been installed, you can then compile Moons with:</p>
<p>make SR=44100</p>
<p>Where SR is the samplerate your machine is running at (which is typically 44100 or
48000). </p>
<p>If this is compiled successfully, you should now have a binary called "moons" that 
you can run with:</p>
<p>./moons</p>
<h3>Using soundpipe and sporth locally with moons</h3>
<p>If you do not want to install soundpipe and sporth on your machine, or do not have
the right admin permissions to do so (like a CCRMA machine), you can place libsporth.a
and libsoundpipe.a into the project folder in a directory you create called "libs".
The header files can be placed in tthe top level drectory. From soundpipe, you will
need "h/soundpipe.h". From Sporth, you will need "tmp.h", but it must be renamed
to "sporth.h" (if tmp.h does not exist, run "make tmp.h" in the Sporth source).</p>
<p>After you have done all that, you can proceed with compiling Moons the usual way.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>When Moons first starts up, you will be faced with a black screen with background
music playig. Clicking somewhere will create a satellite that orbits an 
imaginary point at the center of the screen. Every time a satellite makes a full
rotation, it will create a bell-like tone. </p>
<p>The farther away from the center you click, the larger the radius will be, and 
therefore the time it takes to make a full rotation. Where on the circle you decide
to click will determine the note values. Currently, there are 7 distinct notes to choose
from, each color coded.</p>
<h3>Keyboard Commands</h3>
<p>'q' - cleanly quit</p>
<p>'u' - remove last moon created</p>
<p>'space' - starts/stops the sound (the reverb still stays on)</p>
<p>'1-4' - change the scale/chord</p>
<h2>Architecture of System</h2>
<p>Moons divides up into an audio component, and a visual component, with 
a shared data struct between the two. Time-related things are done at audio-rate. 
In many ways, the video component is subordinate to the audio component.</p>
<p>When a new moon appears on-screen, a new voice is added to the synthesis engine. These
active voices are then computed and summed together (this brute-force approach is preferred over a realtime scheduler). 
These voices are then patched into additional DSP objects in Sporth code. This is easy enough to do because 
Sporth supports arbitrary callback functions. Sporth code is also in charge
of the non-diegetic generative musical accompaniment. </p>
<p>A single <em>voice</em> consists of a single FM operator pair being modulated by two 
triggerable envelopes (one for amplitude, the other for timbre). When a full
rotation is made, the envelopes are triggered and there is audible sound. Since
the envelopes have a fixed attack, hold, and decay pattern, they will only need
to be triggered to turn on, and they will shut off by themselves. There is a maximum
number of voices that can be played at once, and that number can be controlled
via a macro in the source code.</p>
<p>The white "ripples" that you see are an interesting algorithm. To prevent
memory overloading, there are only a finite number of ripples that can be created.
Since their decay time never changes, I implemented a circular FIFO around an array
of ripple data structures. At any given point in time, openGL knows how many 
ripples to draw, and where in the array of ripples to start drawing. </p>
<h2>Initial Design </h2>
<p>Much time was put into articulating what the sequencer should feel and 
look like before writing a single line of code. A semi-formal write-up can 
be found
