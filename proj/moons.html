<h1>Moons</h1>
<p><img src="/res/moons/moons_sm.png" alt="Small screenshot of Moons in action" /></p>
<p><em>Moons</em> is an isorhythmic circular sequencer. It is written using a combination of C and C++.
All visuals are created using OpenGl; All the sounds are snythesized in realtime
using <a href="/proj/sporth.html">Sporth</a>, <a href="/proj/soundpipe.html">Soundpipe</a>, and RTaudio.</p>
<h2>Compilation/Installation</h2>
<p>The latest version of Moons can be found on <a href="https://www.github.com/PaulBatchelor/Moons">github</a>.</p>
<p>Moons requires libsporth (<a href="http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/sporth.git">github</a>) 
and the <strong>dev branch</strong> of libsoundpipe 
(<a href="http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/soundpipe.git">github</a>). On Linux, JACK and
the development libraries will also need to be installed.</p>
<p>After these have been installed, you can then compile Moons with:</p>
<p>make SR=44100</p>
<p>Where SR is the samplerate your machine is running at (which is typically 44100 or
48000). </p>
<p>If this is compiled successfully, you should now have a binary called "moons" that 
you can run with:</p>
<p>./moons</p>
<h3>Using soundpipe and sporth locally with moons</h3>
<p>If you do not want to install soundpipe and sporth on your machine, or do not have
the right admin permissions to do so (like a CCRMA machine), you can place libsporth.a
and libsoundpipe.a into the project folder in a directory you create called "libs".
The header files can be placed in tthe top level drectory. From soundpipe, you will
need "h/soundpipe.h". From Sporth, you will need "tmp.h", but it must be renamed
to "sporth.h" (if tmp.h does not exist, run "make tmp.h" in the Sporth source).</p>
<p>After you have done all that, you can proceed with compiling Moons the usual way.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>When Moons first starts up, you will be faced with a black screen with background
music playig. Clicking somewhere will create a satellite that orbits an 
imaginary point at the center of the screen. Every time a satellite makes a full
rotation, it will create a bell-like tone. </p>
<p>The farther away from the center you click, the larger the radius will be, and 
therefore the time it takes to make a full rotation. Where on the circle you decide
to click will determine the note values. Currently, there are 7 distinct notes to choose
from, each color coded.</p>
<h3>Keyboard Commands</h3>
<p>'q' - cleanly quit</p>
<p>'u' - remove last moon created</p>
<p>'space' - starts/stops the sound (the reverb still stays on)</p>
<p>'1-4' - change the scale/chord</p>
<h2>Initial Design </h2>
<p>Much time was put into articulating what the sequencer should feel and 
look like before writing a single line of code. A semi-formal write-up can 
be found 
<a href="/res/project_orbit/article.pdf">here</a>, and concept art can be found 
<a href="/blog/posts/2015-10-19-milestone_orbit.html">here</a>.</p>
