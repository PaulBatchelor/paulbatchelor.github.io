<h1>Patchwerk</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Patchwerk is a portable ANSI C library for constructing
audio graphs and DSP signal chains. It designed to be
portable, fast, and memory efficient. The core Patchwerk
is written using the CWEB literate programming system.</p>
<p>In addition to the core patchwerk API, there is also an
actively maintained Runt interface with a built-in
collection of DSP nodes from Soundpipe. The goal this Runt
interface is to provide a similar feeling and faster
alternative to Sporth, a stack-based audio language
previously created by the author.</p>
<h2>Why was it created?</h2>
<p>Patchwerk was built to be a better engine than Sporth.
In most ways, this is true. It is much easier to introduce
new modules than in Sporth. Patchwerk can often perform much
better than the Sporth system as well.</p>
<h2>Where does one get this?</h2>
<p>Patchwerk is privately maintained as a Fossil repo, but
a read-only git export can be found on
<a href="https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/patchwerk">github</a></p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<h3>The gist</h3>
<p>Patchwerk produces audio graphs known as <em>patches</em>.</p>
<p>Patches are made up of interconnected things called <em>nodes</em>.</p>
<p>Nodes connect to one another with the use of <em>cables</em>.</p>
<p>All of this is managed using the patchwerk API.</p>
<h3>Computation</h3>
<p>Patchwerk computes audio one block at a time. A block size
of 64 samples is used by default.</p>
<p>Nodes are executed sequentially in the order they are
created. Since nodes can modulate other nodes, nodes
can only make a connection if the node they are connecting
to was created after itself. This simple rule solves the
issue of dependency.</p>
<h3>Cables and block memory</h3>
<p>But wait! Things get a bit trickier. Patchwerk is a
block-based system, meaning any cable that wants to be
audio-rate needs to store things in a buffer. Every
audio-rate cable could have allocated their own buffer,
but this does not scale well from a memory standpoint,
especially on constrained computing environments.</p>
<p>To make memory more manageable, Patchwerk implements
a combination of a memory pool manage buffers.
The memory pool has a pre-allocated set
of buffers to choose from, which removes the scaling issue.</p>
<h3>Stack-based interface</h3>
<p>Buffers in the pool are consantly being overwritten and
re-used. This is managed using a stack interface. Buffers
pushed to the stack are immutable, and when they are popped,
they return back to the pool to be reclaimed.</p>
<p>Highly serial patches (A to B to C), such as the ones you
find in Sporth, lend themselves quite well to this approach.
In fact, thinking in Patchwerk feels a lot like thinking in
Sporth. Many Runt + Patchwerk patches look identical to
Sporth code.</p>
<h3>Buffer Holding</h3>
<p>The buffer stack stops being useful when you have signals
that need to modulate many different components. Stack
operation would make this incredibly difficult to read.</p>
<p>The workaround for this is to explicitly hold the buffer
to ensure it doesn't get reclaimed for the duration that
it is needed, then explicitely un-hold the buffer so that
it can be re-used.</p>
<p>For those reading this far down: buffer holding is the
big gotcha in Patchwerk. If you do not unhold a previously
held buffer, it will cause a certain kind of resource
leak, which is troublesome if you want to recompile +
hotswap patchwerk patches.</p>
<h2>What kind of DSP modules does Patchwerk have?</h2>
<p>By itself, none to speak of. One must define these
externally. The runt patchwerk interface provides a default
set of DSP routines via the soundpipe DSP library. With some
work, one could easily write new DSP modules. With even more
work, one could use FAUST to generate DSP code for
patchwerk (this <em>is</em> doable).</p>
