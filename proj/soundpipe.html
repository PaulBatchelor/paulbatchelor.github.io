<h1>Soundpipe</h1>
<p>Soundpipe is a lightweight music DSP library for musicians and creative coders. It exists
to bring beautiful sounds to your projects. The Soundpipe library is built up of
over 50 (and counting!) high quality modules, many of which have been ported directly from the
time-honored Csound synthesis language. These modules can be combined together to build
unique sounds.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small codebase</li>
<li>Sample-accurate timing</li>
<li>Modular design</li>
<li>Very fast</li>
<li>Well documented</li>
<li>Minimal dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>The source code for Soundpipe can be found on
<a href="http://www.github.com/PaulBatchelor/Soundpipe.git">github</a>.</p>
<h2>Using Soundpipe</h2>
<p>The Soundpipe library is simple and straight forward to use. Every Soundpipe module
has documentation with at least one short C example. By default, the only library Soundpipe
needs is libsndfile, and compiles to a single static library, making it ideal for embedding.</p>
<p>Soundpipe is built so that it is easy to extend and hack on. It is easy to add and take away
modules in Soundpipe for specific project needs.</p>
<p>Here is a example of Soundpipe code. In this example, a 5-second 500hz sine wave (generated
via a table lookup oscillator)
is written to disk:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include "soundpipe.h"

typedef struct {
    sp_osc *osc;
    sp_ftbl *ft;
} UserData;

void write_osc(sp_data *sp, void *udata) {
    UserData *ud = udata;
    sp_osc_compute(data, udp-&gt;osc, NULL, &sp-&gt;out[0]);
}

int main() {
    UserData ud;
    sp_data *sp;
    sp_create(&sp);
    sp_ftbl_create(sp, &ud.ft, 2048);
    sp_osc_create(&ud.osc);

    sp_gen_sine(sp, ud.ft);
    sp_osc_init(sp, ud.osc, ud.ft);
    ud.osc-&gt;freq = 500;
    sp-&gt;len = 44100 * 5;
    sp_process(sp, &ud, write_osc);

    sp_ftbl_destroy(&ud.ft);
    sp_osc_destroy(&ud.osc);
    sp_destroy(&sp);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>What Soundpipe is not</h2>
<p>In an effort to keep Soundpipe simple, Soundpipe tries to follow the Unix philosphy
of doing one thing well, and consequently, doing a lot of other things not as well.</p>
<p>Soundpipe is C library and <em>not</em> a language. For this reason, it lacks some of the niceties and
expressiveness found in music languages like Csound, ChucK, or Supercollider. If you are a composer
looking for another musical language, this is not the place.  That being said, it is quite possible
to build a <a href="sporth.html">language</a> on top of Soundpipe.</p>
<p>Soundpipe by itself doesn't really handle realtime audio, although it can perform quite well it realtime.
Realtime audio is very OS specific, and faithfully maintaining them for every platform would
complicate the codebase tremendously. Developers familiar with callback driven audio APIs like
Portaudio or JACK should have no problem making Soundpipe work in realtime.</p>
