<h1>Prop</h1>
<p>Prop is a tiny rhythmic notation language based on proportions.
Prop can be used to elegantly and succintly express rhythmic 
patterns that would otherwise be very complicated to notate in western 
music notation.</p>
<p>The original implementation of Prop was written in 2014 as a standalone 
program using Flex/Bison, with the intent generate Csound
scores. Later, it was rewritten as a 
<a href="https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/soundpipe/blob/master/modules/prop.c">Soundpipe module</a> 
to generate triggers. </p>
<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>Events are things that happen in time. In prop, only one
event can happen at a time. </p>
<p>The basic events of time are triggers (+) and rests (-):</p>
<pre><code> +-+</code></pre>
<p>A trigger will a produce soundpipe trigger: a one sample tick which can
be fed into modules like <a href="/res/soundpipe/docs/tenv.html">sp_tenv</a> or 
<a href="/res/soundpipe/docs/trand.html">sp_trand</a>. 
A rest will act as a musical rest. </p>
<p>By default, events have a musical duration of a quarter note. These 
durations can be changed through the use of rhythmic operations.</p>
<h3>Rhythms</h3>
<p>The duration of an event can be reduced by a factor of N 
when the events are contained in parenthesis following
the number N:</p>
<pre><code> +2(++)</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, there are three trigger events, where
the last two events are half the duration of first event.
One musical interpretation of this rhythmic figure could be
a quarter note, followed by two eigth notes.</p>
<p>Rhythms can be nested inside other rhythms:</p>
<pre><code> +2(+3(+-+))</code></pre>
<p>Inside the duple rhythm, there is an event followed by 
a triplet rhythm. The triplet rhythm further reduces the duration
of the events inside of it by a factor of 3. </p>
<p>Rhythmic modifiers must be whole number positive integers, but they need
not be traditional factors of 2:</p>
<pre><code> 5(+++2(-+)+)7(+-+-+--+)</code></pre>
<p>There is no restriction on how many events can be inside a rhythmic
modifier (although there is a maximum level of depths):</p>
<pre><code> 5(+)4(+)3(+)2(+)+</code></pre>
<p>Rhythmic durations can also be increased using brackets instead of 
parenthesis:</p>
<pre><code> 2[3(+++)]++</code></pre>
<h2>Probability</h2>
<p>Probability is a more recent feature to the Prop language. They 
exist in the form of maybe events, slices, and sets. These can be
combined together to create very compelling generative rhythms.</p>
<h3>Maybe Events</h3>
<p>Maybe events (?) are events that have a 50% percent chance of triggering:</p>
<pre><code> 4(+-??)2(?+)</code></pre>
<h3>Slices</h3>
<p>Slices allow prop to hold multiple rhythmic figures. At the beginning
of every loop, prop chooses one of the slices at random to perform.
Slices use the pipe (|) as a delimiter:</p>
<pre><code> ++++|+-+-|4(++++)--2(-+)</code></pre>
<h3>Sets</h3>
<p>Sets group up chunks of prop code. They are a very powerful way
to create complex patterns. Sets can be sliced up, which
allow rhythmic segements to be chosen and random. Sets can
also be nested:</p>
<pre><code> +{4(+???)|+|2(+{+|3(+++)})|-}?</code></pre>
