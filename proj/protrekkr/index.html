<p>Protrekkr is a music tracker. I am currently maintaining a fork of it 
<a href="https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/protrekkr.git">here</a></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Protrekkr was originally a cross platform music tracker by 
Juan Antonio Arguelles Rius (AKA Arguru). Protrekkr is a hybrid of modern day
audio software and old-school styles of music tracker.
Protrekkr, (known as NoiseTrekkr at the time)
was also foundational for the commercial software Renoise, a third-generation
music tracker that also blends the old with the new.</p>
<p>Sadly, it would seem that development for Protrekkr has 
stopped entirely. For this reason, I have "adopted" the orphaned Protrekkr. 
My fork of protrekkr contains many changes and features based on my needs
and motivations.</p>
