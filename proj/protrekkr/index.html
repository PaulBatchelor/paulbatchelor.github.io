<p>Protrekkr is a music tracker. I am currently maintaining a fork of it 
<a href="https://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/protrekkr.git">here</a></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Protrekkr was originally a cross platform 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker">music tracker</a>
by 
Juan Antonio Arguelles Rius (AKA Arguru). Protrekkr is a hybrid of modern day
audio software and old-school styles of music tracker.
Protrekkr, (known as NoiseTrekkr at the time)
was also foundational for the commercial software Renoise, a third-generation
music tracker that also blends the old with the new.</p>
<p>Sadly, it would seem that development for <a href="https://github.com/falkTX/protrekkr">Protrekkr</a> 
has stopped entirely. 
For this reason, I have "adopted" the orphaned Protrekkr. 
<a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/protrekkr">My fork</a> 
of protrekkr contains many changes and features based on my needs
and motivations.</p>
<h2>Motivations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hacking on other peoples software and making it do cool things is fun!</li>
<li>I like music trackers, and demoscene culture in general.</li>
<li>Something to use in my workflow, and the next abstraction in my bottoms-up toolchain </li>
<li>Toolchain: Soundpipe <em>(inner loop)</em> -&gt; Sporth <em>(abstract away the inner loop)</em> -&gt; Polysporth <em>(timing + polyphony)</em> -&gt; Protrekkr <em>(visualization, form)</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>New Features in Protrekkr</h2>
<h3>Already implemented</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lua scripting (initial work)</li>
<li>Sporth integration</li>
<li>Better commandline interface </li>
</ul>
<h3>Planned</h3>
<ul>
<li>Refactoring (ongoing)</li>
<li>Text-based output formats rather than binary formats (for source control) </li>
<li>Sporth Plugin(s) </li>
<li>Custom Widgets</li>
<li>A library and API</li>
<li>Devolution from C++ to C (most of it is really C already)</li>
</ul>
