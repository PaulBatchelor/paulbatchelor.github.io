<h1>Sporth</h1>
<p>Sporth (SoundPipe fORTH) is a small hackable stack-based music programming language that uses
a Soundpipe-based audio engine called soundPlumber.</p>
<p>Compile the latest version <a href="http://www.github.com/PaulBatchelor/Sporth.git">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stack oriented paradigm</li>
<li>Written entirely in portable C</li>
<li>100+ unit generators to choose from</li>
<li>Powered by the Soundpipe DSP library</li>
<li>Unix-Friendly</li>
<li>Small codebase</li>
<li>Powerful C API</li>
<li>Easily extendable</li>
<li>Easily embeddable</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Sporth?</h2>
<p><strong>For composers</strong>, Sporth is a different approach to making sound. Stack based languages
are somewhat novel in the world of musical languages, and lend themselves well to modular
sound design scenarios.
Sporth syntax is simple to learn,
and rewarding to master. Sound designers and composers fluent in languages like Csound, ChucK,
and Supercollider will find Sporth a new and refreshing take on the same basic concepts.</p>
<p><strong>For developers</strong>, Sporth has a simple API that allows it to be used inside
of other applications. In addition to compiling Sporth code, the API has access
to other features of Sporth that would otherwise be unavailable, such as
audio-rate software channels, and user defined function callbacks. </p>
<p><strong>For Unix fans</strong>, Sporth tries its best to be as Unixy as possible. Sporth can read code from
standard input, allowing users to programatically generate Sporth code via shell scripts.
Sporth also has the ability to both read/write from STDIN/STDOUT, allowing Sporth to process
and be processed by other applications like SoX, Csound, RSound, and even other Sporth instances!</p>
<h2>Some Sporth Code</h2>
<p>Sporth is stack based. Arguments are written first, then the function (also known as a
unit generator, or "ugen") is called.</p>
<p>Here is a simple sine wave at 440Hz, with an amplitude of 0.5:</p>
<pre><code> 440 0.5 sine</code></pre>
<p>Internally, this is what Sporth is doing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Push 440 to the stack.</li>
<li>Push 0.5 stack</li>
<li>Look up and call the function "sine".</li>
<li>"sine" pops 440 and 0.5 off the stack for parameters.</li>
<li>"sine" computes a sample of audio, and pushes it onto the stack.</li>
<li>Soundpipe pops the sine sample off the stack and writes it to disk.</li>
<li>Go back to step 1, and repeat until the desired length of audio is written.</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to the blackbox nature of Sporth, ugens can be combined and nested together.</p>
<p>We add onto our sine wave and add vibrato at 6hz going up and down 50hz:</p>
<pre><code> 6 50 sine 440 add 0.5 sine</code></pre>
<p>A sine wave of 6hz with an amplitude of 50 is being added to the constant 440, modulating the
440Hz freqency of the sine wave with an amplitude of 0.5.</p>
<p>Step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Push 6 onto the stack</li>
<li>Push 50 onto the stack</li>
<li>"sine" pops 6 and 50 off the stack.</li>
<li>"sine" computes a single sample of audio and pushes it to the stack</li>
<li>Push 440 to to the stack.</li>
<li>"add" pops the computed sine sample and 440 off the stack.</li>
<li>"add" adds these values togeter and pushes this onto the stack.</li>
<li>0.5 is pushed onto the stack.</li>
<li>"sine" pops the summed value and 0.5 off the stack.</li>
<li> "sine" computes a single sample of audio and pushes it onto the stack.</li>
<li> Soundpipe pops the sine sample off the stack and writes it to disk.</li>
<li> Go back to step 1 and repeat.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Sporth is Unix friendly</h2>
<p>The Sporth CLI tries it's best to be Unix friendly.</p>
<p>Instead of reading from a file, Sporth can read from standard input:</p>
<pre><code> echo &quot;440 0.5 sine&quot; | sporth -d 10s -o sine.wav</code></pre>
<p>This will write a 10 second 440Hz sine to a file called sine.wav.</p>
<p>Instead of writing to a wav file, Sporth can write raw audio data to standard output
to be read by other standard applications.</p>
<pre><code> echo &quot;440 0.5 sine&quot; | sporth -d 5s -b raw |\
 sox -t raw -r 44100 -b 32 -e floating-point - \
 sine.wav fade q 1 5</code></pre>
<p>This example pipes standard output to sox, where it applies a 1 second fade in/out
and writes to a file called sine.wav.</p>
<p>Sporth has the ability to read raw audio data from standard input using the "in"
ugen. The simplest Sporth patch that can read from STDIN would look like this:</p>
<pre><code> in</code></pre>
<p>It can be implemented like so:</p>
<pre><code> cat /dev/urandom | sporth -d 10s in.sp</code></pre>
<p>One can even use other Sporth patches as an input source, allowing you to
daisy chain Sporth patches:</p>
<pre><code> sporth -d 10s -b raw sine.sp | sporth -d 10s in.sp</code></pre>
<p>Your time honored Unix tools can now be used to help sculpt your computer music.
How cool is that!</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>In the project folder, ugen_reference.txt is a mini reference for all the ugens in Sporth, with
names, arguments, outputs, and a brief descriptions. When you install Sporth, a shell script called
"ugen_lookup" is installed as well. To look up what 'tenv' does, run the command "ugen_lookup tenv".
ugen_lookup also excepts any regular expressions supported by grep.</p>
<p>Most of the ugens in Sporth exist under the same name in the Soundpipe library, which has much
more thorough documentation of each module. In the soundpipe folder, documentation can be generated
by running "make docs".</p>
