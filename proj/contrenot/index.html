<h1>Contrenot</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The <em>Contrenot</em> (pronounced "con-truh-no") is a musical interface designed
to loosely emulate the mechanics of a bowed upright bass. It's inspiration
comes from other electronic musical interfaces such as the Ondes Martenot, 
the Gametrak (as used by SLORK), and the Omatone. The Contrenot has a form factor 
similar to that of an electric upright bass. The neck consists of a high-resolution
linear softpot and FSR for monophonic pitch and aftertouch detection. The body houses a
pull-string sensor, created from a gutted tape measure spring, a high resolution 
incremental rotary encoder, and custom 3d printed parts. The pull-string sensor is able to detect 
velocity and motion very precisely, allowing for very nuanced control similar to 
bowing a bass.
All sensors and components are powered by an Arduino Uno. Data is sent over USB serial to
a Linux computer, where it processed and mapped to sound parameters in Sporth, a 
stack-based audio synthesis language. </p>

<h2>Code </h2>
<p>Code used for the Contrenot can be found on 
<a href="http://www.github.com/paulbatchelor/contrenot">github</a>. The repo includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arduino sketches</li>
<li>Resources for 3d printed components (OpenSCAD, STL, and gcode files)</li>
<li>C code for the Contrenot Sporth plugin </li>
<li>Sporth patches for sound generation</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this isn't a DIY project: documentation and instructions are nonexistent 
and some things might be missing. Nonetheless, the code is still there for the
ones who are curious about those sorts of things.</p>
