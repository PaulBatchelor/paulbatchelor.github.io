<h1>Worgle</h1>
<p>Worgle is a fast and portable tangler for programs written in
a limited subset of <a href="https://orgmode.org">org</a>, which includes
noweb-style expansion for literate programming.</p>
<p>The source code can be <a href="https://github.com/paulbatchelor/worgle">found on github</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote Worgle as a follow-up to my initial experiences with
<a href="/blog/posts/2018-09-21-org-babel-impressions.html">literate programming using org-mode</a>.
While org and org-mode have the potential to be great modern-day tools for
Knuthian-style literate programming, I found their current implementations
to be inferior to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWEB">CWEB</a>.
Tangling org-code with emacs is painfully slow, to the point of being
unusable.
Tangled C/C++ code does not export
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Line-Control.html">line declaration macros</a>,
making debugging a terribly impractical experience.</p>
<p>Worgle is written in itself, and is bootstrapped using a minimalist ANSI
C org tangler called Orgle.</p>
<p>In addition to tangling code, some initially steps have been taken to
produce an HTML exporter, a process classically referred to as <em>weaving</em>
code. This weaver, called Sorg, is also written in ANSI C using Worgle.
While incomplete, it is quite usable. Examples of Sorg being used
to generate HTML have been posted for
<a href="/res/worgle/sorg_toc.html">Sorg</a>
and
<a href="/res/worgle/worgle_toc.html">Worgle</a>. In order to match the CSS of
this website, these pages with sorg via a
<a href="/res/worgle/mkpage.html">shell script</a>.</p>
