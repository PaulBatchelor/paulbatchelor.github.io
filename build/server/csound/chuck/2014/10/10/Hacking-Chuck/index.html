  <p>I’m very proud to introduce the world to my latest hack: plopping Csound inside of ChucK. </p>

<p>This idea spawned from a problem I was having with ChucK: I was enjoying the language, but I wasn’t enjoying the sounds it was creating. The built in Unit Generators (called Ugens) left more to be desired from a sound design point of view. Luckily, there was documentation on how to build your own UGens, so I used that to bring Csound’s beautiful reverbsc opcode into ChucK. This reverb in ChucK suddenly made the language sound infinitely better. I then wanted to see how hard it would be bring the Csound API into ChucK as a UGen. That way, I could use the sound of Csound with the level of control in ChucK. </p>

<p>The Csound and ReverbSC UGens are the start of what I like to call the Blackbox Plugins for ChucK. The github for the Blackbox plugins can be found <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/blackbox">here</a>. </p>

<p>Blackbox is designed to be compiled with the main ChucK codebase. In order to do this, you must download the latest ChucK source code, clone the Blackbox repo in the src/ directory, and then use the patch provided in the repo on the ChucK codebase. After downloading the ChucK source, you can do all this from the command line:</p>

<p>tar zxvf chuck-1.3.4.0.tgz
cd chuck-1.3.4.0/src
git clone https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/blackbox
patch -p2 blackbox/blackbox.patch</p>

<p>ChucK can then be compiled using “make”. Running make without any arguments will list all the available platforms. Choose the one that is for you. At the moment, the blackbox plugins have only been tested on Linux machines. </p>
