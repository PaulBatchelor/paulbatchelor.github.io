<p>The debug mode flag is never set to true here. Confirmed with printing and filtering output.

<p> Also confirmed that it doesn't matter if you're using the function <code>dbg</code> I made or checking the variable itself. It's the same. So, I'm pretty sure the <code>dbg</code> shortcut function is fine.

<p>"cpp" would have to be added to the "no incoming" table. Which, I would expect wouldn't be happening. 
</p>
<p> The <code>nodes_connected_to</code> function: which way is the direction? if "nodes connected to A" returns B, is it "B->A" or "A->B"? 
</p>
<p> It's checking if the node is on the left, so "A->B", so the parent nodes. 
</p>
<p> If this is true, <code>header_file_looks_like_boilerplate</code> (id 137) should return the <code>cpp</code> node (id 134). Let's test this. 
</p>
<p> It's not showing up. Nevermind that was my fault.

<p> Okay the cpp node is indeed showing up as expected.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>This is insightful: the cpp node shows up 2/3 times. The missing node here is <code>magsign_cpp</code>. So, <code>cpp</code> might be forever missing if <code>magsign_cpp</code> is missing. That's enough for today.

<p> Of the three, It's also the only one that only shows up once as a left-node (it only has one parent node). That parent is <code>magsign_cpp</code>.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I don't think the edges are supposed to be nil, even though they are here. 
</p>
<p> I have another hunch: there is a local node called "rust", and the namespace for these external nodes also starts with "rust". Going to re-introduce the external nodes, and change the local "rust" node to be "rustrust". It could be that there is some faulty logic related to string matching somewhere. 
</p>
<p> Neither worked. Okay, so I have to check out those nil edges now.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>While populating a local copy of the edges table (to be pruned later by the topsort algo), I added a check to see if the left node id shows up in the nodes list. If it doesn't, it indicates that it is an externally linked node outside of the namespace. 
</p>
<p> TL;DR: Check for foreign nodes.
