<p>So, poke is really bumming me out. It's too much abuse.

<p> Using no sound, just circles, to try out this initial idea. 
</p>
<p> There is a big white circle on the page. You click to place other smaller black circles (pellets). The circle waits, then moves to each circle to "eat" them, then repeats the process until there aren't any other circles.

<p>But, weird stroke bug in firefox. The line has variable thickness, and some dots. In chromium, this is a non-issue.

<p>It's traveling on a line, so maybe just the line equation. It can be a normalized slope velocity too. Something to add to a point until it reaches a target.

<p>So, calculate progress, and then use an easing function to make it so it can slow down or speed up to a target.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>It's not quit what I wanted it be. I'd need to rework it to make it work with easings. The current implementation just calculates an relative trajectory, and I'm adjusting how fast that trajectory goes based on the position. interpolating between two points would be better.

<p>Behaviors now have different interpolation schemes. They are also randomized now, and can have randomized  speeds.

<p>It really should aim to choose the closest pellet. 
</p>
<p> The only sound I have in mind right now are the sounds of placing pellets. One of those bubble popping sounds. Like the sounds on the switch. 
</p>
<p> The "consume and become larger" mechanic was an interesting ad-hoc idea. But it's Katamari Damacy. I should look into that game. They have a crazy soundtrack from what I remember. 
</p>
<p> I want to play with better colors here. Manic Japanese pastel colors. Think Kirby and Mario. 
</p>
<p> I think this game soundtrack should feel very tactile.

<p>wii music: good vibe. something about the timing 
</p>
<p> getz/gilberto girl from ipanema: there's something more playful about this pairing. I think it's cuz there's a bit more of film cliche happening. 
</p>
<p> Severance OST Theodire Shapiro "Labor of Love": The triangle makes this very funny. It's definitely a matter of tempo. 
</p>
<p> wii shop: ~170 BPM, ipanema: ~140 BPM, severance: ~125BPM.a 
</p>
<p> Desafinado Gilberto/Jobim/Getz ~140 BPM. This one also is very playful juxtaposition.

<p>Had a nice high-level chat with RB about a possible implementation. He called it an "object pool", which is pretty much exactly what I'm going after.
