<p>I've been trying to, in good faith, read through the the "javascript trivia" section. I wanted to make flashcards because it felt like a rote memorization. But like, most of the time, the questions aren't focused enough, and answers meander a little bit. 
</p>
<p> The nice thing about these questions is that there are references and resources. Most of these are stack overflow and blog posts, and while I've been saving some of these to read, I'm kind of done with the casual long-winded almost correct answers that come from blog posts.
