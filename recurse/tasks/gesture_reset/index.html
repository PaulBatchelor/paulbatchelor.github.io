<p>I want to not only do the fix, but create a test in the test suite that showcases the problem before the fix is created, just so I know that I properly understand the problem that I am trying to solve.

<p>I need to re-remember how this rephasor works. Luckily, I wrote documentation for the C implementation. 
</p>
<p> The current rust implementation is a little cryptic. Add docstrings now.
