<p>We were struggling getting zoom to work with the iOS emulator. But our thing did technically work. Sort of felt like I made a jerk of myself in front of everyone. Oops.

<p> John Cage once asked how he felt about his audience laughing at some of his (admittedly odd) work, to which he replied "I prefer laughter to tears". No tears, only laughter. I suppose I was entertaining. So, I'll take the win.

<p>I think I am what you'd call an Introvert's Introvert. Being around people at RC is quite enjoyable, but it has been draining for me. I'm really starting to feel it. I'll need to see what I can do to find some quiet and recharge later this week. 
</p>
<p> Suddenly being around so many people after years of being around so few is an ongoing adjustment for me. Still, it is important to me that I try to push myself a bit and coax myself out of my apartment into uncomfortable situations. The people here are friendly.
