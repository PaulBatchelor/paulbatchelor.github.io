<div class="comment-block">
<p>In the true yak-shaving tradition, I want to build a quick webscraper that takes all the links in the LC75 page and then prints them to PDF. From there, I can view them on my remarkable, so I can be a way from my computer and study them with pen and paper.

<p><a href="#2024_07_12_08_56" id="2024_07_12_08_56">2024-07-12 08:56</a>: I have still not started this. Sigh. #LC75</p>
<p><a href="#2024_07_14_10_30" id="2024_07_14_10_30">2024-07-14 10:30</a>: Clearly, I really do not want to do this. #LC75</p>
<p><a href="#2024_07_22_08_57" id="2024_07_22_08_57">2024-07-22 08:57</a>: How can I work on this stuff offline? #LC75</p>
<div class="comment-block">
<p>Leetcode provides validation of solutions, which is nice. But having a format that distills the problems into something offline for reference would be nice. 
</p>
<p> I think I might just manually transcribe the questions to markdown and put them in a repo.

<p>I am putting it in "main" instead of priority. 
</p>
<p> Let me get these last few projects in a good place (<a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_trio">demo-trio</a> and <a href="/recurse/tasks/dagzet_rust">dagzet-rust</a>), and then I'll try to find time to start this? 
</p>
<p> I know, I know. I'm putting it off.
