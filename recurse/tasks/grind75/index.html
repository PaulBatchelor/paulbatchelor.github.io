<p>What's tough here is the acceptance criteria. It needs to be 3 unique indices and the combination itself needs to be unique. Having the nested 3-loop is cleaner because the variables are in scope. Doing it with the backtracking approach requires cramming data in the recursive function.

<p> dead end. Moving on

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The loops are moved around and hidden, but there still seems to be 3 distinct loops. The thing that's interesting (ish) here is that they are treating the problem as an extension of twosum, and re-using that logic, calling a version of twosum inside of 3sum.

<p>Per the recommendation of several people, I am going to just the Leetcode website to write code. It has the verification and eveything, and will help me pick up on weird edge cases.
