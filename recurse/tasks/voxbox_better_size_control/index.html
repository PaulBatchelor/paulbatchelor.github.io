<p>This will be a good way to test out tract length while on my Linux box. -- Actually, this won't work. Interpolation doesn't smooth discontinuities, but allows smoothing transitions with floating point values. I will need to build an example.

<p>I was hoping this would be a quick matter of linear interpolation between the last two samples at the output, but I I'm still getting issues. It's starting to turn into more of a DSP problem than I'd like it be, which is not why I'm here at this program. So, I'm putting it to rest for now.

<p> The attempts are managed in the "tractlen" branch on my voxbox repo

<p>Somehow I think the fractional tract length needs to be considered while computing the scatering junctions. But I'm not sure how yet. I added in best guess but it's not right. Okay I really really need to stop this.
