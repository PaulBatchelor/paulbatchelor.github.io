<div class="comment-block">
<p>One of my concerns with building a react app is that if I host these on my droplet, it's going to clog things up in and take space. What I want to know is: when I go through the process of minifying and exporting the code, how much space does it end up being? What goes into uploading and running this on my webserver? 
</p>
<p> My other concern (which I'm trying not to think about too hard about) is: my website is 99% static, and introducing JS could mean adding an attack surface to my website. Probably just being paranoid.

<p>Did this by running <code>npm run build</code> then examining size of "build" directory. 
</p>
<p> By comparison, my vanilla JS project was only 12kb.
