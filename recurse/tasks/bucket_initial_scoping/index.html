<p>I want to build demos exploring a some of the core "verbs" I wrote down, like "poke", "eat", "move (to target). Probably in p5. Sound design would be a great thing to garnish it with after. Sound design will be another task too.

<p>Other than the sound engine working, getting the drawing pipeline working feels like it'll be the most time consuming thing. I don't know if I want to spend my time doing that.

<p>Basically, "A Blob Named Bucket" will most likely be a culmination of other mechanics I try out. 
</p>
<p> As I type this. I can't help but wonder if this will be too time consuming to try and implement. 
</p>
<p> You know what. I'm going to story-board the gameplay for bucket. That's what is missing.

<p>A good follow-up to my initial scoping. I'm kind of paralyzed with tech stack choices, and I'm very limited with time, so boiling down game design is a good choice. I know how with a certain degree of accuracy how long pen and paper takes.
