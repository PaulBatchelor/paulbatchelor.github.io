<p>The last part of this chapter had the reader implement things like AND, OR, NOT from NAND. I could get NOT without too much trouble. I figured out an implementation of AND, sort of (NOT-NAND did not immediately come to mind. I was too busy trying to find patterns in all the cases). I struggle with OR, even after looking at the answers. It's clear I need to build up more intuition.
