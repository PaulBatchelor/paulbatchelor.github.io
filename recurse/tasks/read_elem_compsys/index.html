<p>The last part of this chapter had the reader implement things like AND, OR, NOT from NAND. I could get NOT without too much trouble. I figured out an implementation of AND, sort of (NOT-NAND did not immediately come to mind. I was too busy trying to find patterns in all the cases). I struggle with OR, even after looking at the answers. It's clear I need to build up more intuition.

<p>Finished up reading last bits in chapter 1. Read chapter 2 (shorter) on Boolean Arithmetic and their ALU. 
</p>
<p> I have not done any of the projects yet. I am hoping this can be one of those things I can return back to when I have a chunk of time available. 
</p>
<p> I want to believe that "just reading" without doing projects is "not nothing, not everything". That is to say, I hope I'm getting something worthwhile from this.

<p>I read the chapter in one sitting. I imagine it's much easier to read about implementing an assembler than it is to actually implement one. At some point, I'll try to find time to actually work this all out. 
</p>
<p> Teach Yourself Computer Science (TYCS) recommends reading the first six chapters of this book. I have done this. I think this is good enough.
