<p>This could be done in a p5 app. I just want a circle that giggles and jitters when you poke at it. It'd be a good pre-cursor to other experiences I want to make like "A Blob Named Bucket".

<p>It's a good contrast from the vocal chords demo, and a good way to start the more whimsical toyetic vocal demos.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The most important thing for this demo is the vocal-like chattering. So this example will more or less aim to build the model. The new thing to try out will be morphing between DRM shapes. The critter here will be quite small, so the tract size wlil be quite small. 
</p>
<p> I will be thinking more about the design today.
