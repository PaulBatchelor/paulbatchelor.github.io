<p>The most important thing for this demo is the vocal-like chattering. So this example will more or less aim to build the model. The new thing to try out will be morphing between DRM shapes. The critter here will be quite small, so the tract size wlil be quite small. 
</p>
<p> I will be thinking more about the design today.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The offline example should have some parts that will eventually be designed to be modulated by user input (poking). Poking can be simulating using a triggered gate. The gate would go into an envelope (envelopes?) of some sort as way to shape things like fundamental pitch and jitter.

<p>Basically, my source of inspiration for this one are those poptart commercials that were around during the early 2000s &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/demos#poptarts">demos/poptarts</a>&gt;&gt; 
</p>
<p> It'd be nice to get collision working for the eyes, because I think they will bulge out of the face occasionally. 
</p>
<p> Mouth shape needs to be flexible enough to support mouth shapes. I want these to be synchronized with the mouth shapes being synthesized by the audio.

<p>Chatter sound needs to be consolidated into a struct rather than in a main function. There also needs to be a poke method, which will eventually be the thing called when the user pokes the circle on the screen.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Up to this point, "poking" has been simulating using a metro object. This metro needs to be pulled out of the struct, and replaced with a gate fed into a threshold generator. The metro function will exist outside, and when it ticks an impulse, it will call the poke method. The poke method will flip a gate signal on and off. Inside ChatterBox, it will detect changes in the gate and turn those into triggers like before.
