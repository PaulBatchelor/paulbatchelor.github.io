<div class="comment-block">
<p>This time around, I am hoping to learn how to make some kind of musical instrument sound toy for the gameboy. I want to do it in assembly, and I want it to run on my analogue pocket. If I build a ROM that allows me to push buttons and make it actively control the APU somehow, I'd call that a win.

<p>Actually, I'm going to do the part 2 tutorial now. I feel like I need more context than what the docs are giving me, and it would be nice to have something I know works.

<p>Got it displaying stuff with a Duck.

<p> Thing is, 16:30 is coming up quickly, and sound is more important than making a game. If I can figure out to just get a pulse working, that'll be a success.
