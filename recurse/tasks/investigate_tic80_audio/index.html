<div class="comment-block">
<p>How hackable is it? Is it feasible to shove my rust DSP code into the TIC80, audio callback, and control it from tic80 code? 
</p>
<p> I think this could be a fruitful way to build an ecosystem of toys that match my current aesthetic. I have semi-long term plans for this potentially. 
</p>
<p> I say "semi-potentially" because for its constraints, the software has quite a complex software stack. I don't expect this to be the most portable thing in the world. The most portable things are ideas, and after that, bytes of data (8 bits to a byte is fairly universal). There is a cartridge format, which may end up being a promising data format for portability, but we'll see. 
</p>
<p> Short term (as in this batch), portability or longevity is not a concern. I just want to hack stuff.

<p>The idea is to find the files, then add them to codestudy. 
</p>
<p> I think I found the music. One file <code>sound.c</code>, almost 600 lines. Not too bad, actually. 
</p>
<p> Adding to codestudy. 
</p>
<p> why didn't sound.c import? 
</p>
<p> oh it did, but the CSS broke. why did it break? Gotta look into this. again.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I think I'm pretty close to understanding how the callback stores audio into buffers. There's a resampling step which I need to figure out more, but I believe I know where I can inject custom DSP. At that point, I'll be ready to make a follow-up task.
