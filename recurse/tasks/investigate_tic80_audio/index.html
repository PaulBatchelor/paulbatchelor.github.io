<div class="comment-block">
<p>How hackable is it? Is it feasible to shove my rust DSP code into the TIC80, audio callback, and control it from tic80 code? 
</p>
<p> I think this could be a fruitful way to build an ecosystem of toys that match my current aesthetic. I have semi-long term plans for this potentially. 
</p>
<p> I say "semi-potentially" because for its constraints, the software has quite a complex software stack. I don't expect this to be the most portable thing in the world. The most portable things are ideas, and after that, bytes of data (8 bits to a byte is fairly universal). There is a cartridge format, which may end up being a promising data format for portability, but we'll see. 
</p>
<p> Short term (as in this batch), portability or longevity is not a concern. I just want to hack stuff.

<p>The idea is to find the files, then add them to codestudy. 
</p>
<p> I think I found the music. One file <code>sound.c</code>, almost 600 lines. Not too bad, actually. 
</p>
<p> Adding to codestudy. 
</p>
<p> why didn't sound.c import? 
</p>
<p> oh it did, but the CSS broke. why did it break? Gotta look into this. again.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I think I'm pretty close to understanding how the callback stores audio into buffers. There's a resampling step which I need to figure out more, but I believe I know where I can inject custom DSP. At that point, I'll be ready to make a follow-up task.

<p>It could be that that's just a raw byte format. The sound code here is fairly involved. I'm going to need to look at this more.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>It is unclear to me when things are computing a single sample of audio (tick), and when it's writing to a buffer. 
</p>
<p> For example, SOKOL seems to be writing shorts (16-bit). 
</p>
<p> What I do know is that samples eventually show up in something called "product->samples.buffer", but I cannot find that definition yet (there's a lot of macro magic in this repo). There is also a buffer count too. It appears that these could be interleaved samples.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>As far as I can tell, <code>product.samples</code> is dynamically generated. It's not actually anywhere in a struct. The <code>tic80</code> stuct I have yet to actually find. Same goes for <code>product.samples.buffer</code> and <code>product.samples.count</code>.  
</p>
<p> There are two top audio callbacks that tell tic80 to generate soud (how much sound not sure? but it's definitely multi-channel). I'm looking at the one sokol uses called <code>studio_sound</code>. This calls <code>tic_core_synth_sound()</code>, which I assume writes to <code>product.samples.buffer</code> somehow. If I can inject an effects processor right after the buffer is fully written, I think that can be enough for me.

<p>These calls seem to happen right before they are resampled.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I think I know about enough to get started on hacking in a sine tone into the TIC-80 sound codebase. 
</p>
<p> A sine tone is ideal because it's a pitched pure tone, and it can be easy to tell if I'm getting the buffering and sample rate correct. If I can get a sine.
