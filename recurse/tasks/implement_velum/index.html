<p>Velum is not implemented in tubular &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/voxbox#tubular">voxbox/tubular</a>&gt;&gt;, but it is in implemented in tract &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/voxbox#tract">voxbox/tract</a>&gt;&gt;. Getting tract code tangled and re-examine what needs to be added.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The original tract waveguide had a fixed size of 28, which should be a size in CM (which will most likely be expressed as proptional percentage of the tract width in practice).

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The harddcoded size is 28, which I believe is 2x oversampled, so that's 14 samples. 
</p>
<p> Looks like it is around 10-12cm: 
</p>
<p> To derive, I opened the equation I was using to convert tract len (cm) to samples in bc: 
<pre><code>(len * 0.01)/(speed_of_sound / sr)</pre></code>
<p>or
<pre><code>(16 * 0.01)/(343.0 / 44100.0)</pre></code>

<p>I forgot this week was the game jam. My velum work will have to wait a few days.
