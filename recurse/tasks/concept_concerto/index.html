<div class="comment-block">
<p>I want to move forward with an ensemble demo, but coming up with the interface has been a blocker for me. I don't want to blindly recreate Blob Opera or Choir. It's been hard to see past that. How do you meaningfully control multiple voices? 
</p>
<p> Then I realized, it was never about controlling multiple voices in Blob Opera or Choir. You were always controlling one voice at a time, and the rest would follow. A leader-follower, or soloist-orchestra relationship. Such a thing I will call a "concerto" format.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Things involving Gesture mechanics. Specifically, the concept of getting some kind of "auto-accompaniment" to work with Gesture signal generator systems. Something something event scheduler. Might be good to write some things down.
