<div class="comment-block">
<p>I've been on and off about this for a few days. I think it could be a good interface to try and tune vocal synth parameters. But, I should make a decision by end of day. 
</p>
<p> Thinking about using this with my number pad, somehow. I like the minimalism of the numpad, and consider it an interesting interface challenge for the task of musical sequencing. The tablet could be a good way to get continuous fine tuned gestural control. 
</p>
<p> Performance interface too?

<p>During my walk, I realized this was a perfect device for exploring vocal synthesis control. A sort of gold standard I could use to try out interface concepts before porting to the web. 
</p>
<p> I'm starting to see building instruments for the web as "redux", as far as solo interactive musical experiences go. It's incredibly convenient, but ultimately the medium of the browser is still lackluster, and usually there are tradeoffs. 
</p>
<p> Future thinking: collaboration and share-ability are the big strengths of the web. Something I haven't really explored yet. Maybe that's something to think about?
