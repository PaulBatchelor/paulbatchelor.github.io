<h1>implement initial gesture path</h1>
In Gesture Synthesis, a path is a primitive construct that builds up a single gesture from a list of values, which are referred to as gesture vertices. A gesture vertice has 3 components: a scalar value, a rate multiplier that determines duration, and a behavior parameter that determines how to interpolate to the next value.

<p>I think the path argument might just be a reference to an array of gesture vertices, which seems to mean lifetimes. no no, this will be good for me.

<p>In theory, I think I have something that <b>might</b> work. But now I have to get back to interfaces.

<p>I realized I had to make sure behavior logic was working as expected <code>(Aval -> (A_dur, A_bhvr) -> B_val)</code></p>
