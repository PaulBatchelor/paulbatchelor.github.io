<div class="comment-block">
<p>Now, for the initial process of introducing these eventful gestures. 
</p>
<p> Before any events can be added to any gestures, we need to be able to simulate adding events. Events should only be added after the lead has held onto a pitch for one period. 
</p>
<p> The easiest way to do this using a global timer that keeps track the phasor ticks, which occur once a second. If a u32 is used, how many seconds is that? 
</p>
<p> Okay, so that's about a millenium short of 50k years. I think there's no general risk of things overflowing. I will be long dead and forgotten before that happens to a potential user. 
</p>
<p> Is this enough granularity though if I want to detect pitch changes? Maybe not actually.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>First, implement things so that it detects changes in pitch. Then, build a sample and hold with along with a global monotonically increasing clock that increments at the start of every tick. 
</p>
<p> Now, any time a pitch change occurs in the lead, it can be compared against the sampled pitch. If the pitch is different, but the timestamps aren't, the whole period is marked as having been changed for the rest of the period. 
</p>
<p> The "dirty bit" trick is used in situations where the pitch changes quickly inside a period.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>One of the things I am doing in Trio is forcing a phase reset on pen down so the voices always stagger the same way. The funderlying rephasor in the gesture signal generator does not have a way of handling phase resets, so it'll assume a faster tempo change and cause unwanted jumps in time. The rephasor needs a way to be told that there has been a phase reset, which would cause it to skip calculating the delta time in the next sample tick. 
</p>
<p> I wonder if we can build a test around this?

<p>Right now, a changing pitch triggers a set of chord progressions. But if they move too quickly, only the last one is heard. Which means effectively an arbitrary chord transition. 
</p>
<p> How to prevent this? A chord isn't a chord until all 3 voices commit. If the lead changes pitch, it uses the stored chord as a reference point. As it continues to change, this chord will continue to be used. The upper voice is the last person to commit to a chord, so only then should the reference chord be updated. 
</p>
<p> When the chord is officially committed for selection, only then does that chord get registered in the chord frequency table.
