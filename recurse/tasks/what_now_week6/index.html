<p>There is always the temptation to bite off more than one can chew, and once again I feel like this is starting to happen. I'll probably want to leave this up for the rest of the week and see if any more thoughts emerge.

<p>I want to focus on designing more musical experiences using my vocal synthesizer, that run in the browser. 
</p>
<p> This, however, is not enough of a project, and risks being too design oriented rather than technically oriented. I am also quite seriously considering putting some work into hacking my vocal synthesis DSP written in Rust into tic80. 
</p>
<p> Why tic80? I like the aesthetic. And hacking the software's source code seems to very much be in the spirit of RC. It is also possible to export to WASM, but not with the hacks. As a stretch, it may be possible to somehow hack the wasm TIC cartridge wasm blob, or even write a custom TIC loader based on the TIC-80 codebase. 
</p>
<p> Design and presentation is still and important factor. There will be two kinds musical interactions: ensemble and solo. The main ensemble sining project will probably be something similar to blob opera. The main solo singing project will be "A Blob Named Bucket", a chittering singinig virtual pet that you have to coax out of hiding with food. 
</p>
<p> A Blob Named Bucket will be the more complicated project, requiring a procedurally generated critter generator, and a character engine simulator Bucket's behavior. For this reason, these components will be broken up into smaller self-contained demos. These need to be self contained because it's likely I may not be able to get to the final project. 
</p>
<p> The ensemble demo will probably just be for the web using p5, and will building off of the chords demo I made in the first half. 
</p>
<p> TIC-80 demos will do their best to follow some of the ideas in the p5 demos. Could be thought of as "redux" versions? I want to do my best to refine the mechanics of these demos, reduce until they are distilled into simple elegant forms of sonic interaction. 
</p>
<p> Tooling will need to be made as well. These will probably be HTML/WASM, and for practice, I will use React for these.

<p>I did not think about this too hard for this. That's what next week can be for?
