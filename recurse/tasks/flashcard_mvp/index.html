<p>There's a lot of information I need to ingest, and I am starting to think having a system in place is going to be necessary. 
</p>
<p> I already have a data format figured out. It's built into my dagzet system. I'll need to get it working with the rust implementation, but that shouldn't take too long. 
</p>
<p> What I don't have figured out is a spaced repetition system. Something that allows me to go through a set flashcards and update their frequency depending on how I answer. 
</p>
<p> I imagine most of the heavy lifting will be done with SQLite. A small CLI (prototype in python?) could be used to present a set of (up to) N flashcards from a given set of namespaces, randomly selected from a weighted distribution based on priority. 
</p>
<p> Based on how I answer, priority for each flashcard gets updated.

<p>I was trying to make some flashcards to test, and I realized making well-scoped and well organized flashcards from what I've been reading takes more work than making the MVP program that displays them. So, pausing on this until I figure that out more.
