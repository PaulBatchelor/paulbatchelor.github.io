<p>Gotta love this. There's a header file called <code>execinfo.h</code> that doesn't exist on musl (alpine) and there's a specific macro that disables including this file. There's probably a way to set this macro using a flag somewhere in a deeply nested Makefile, but it's just going to be easier to comment these bits out. It's only this file. FAUST is like this sometimes.

<p> It is building... 
</p>
<p> I get weird permission issues when it builds? <a href=" https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72978485/git-submodule-update-failed-with-fatal-detected-dubious-ownership-in-reposit"> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72978485/git-submodule-update-failed-with-fatal-detected-dubious-ownership-in-reposit</a>. So sketchy.

<p>I have this feeling that one of the optional submodules is causing issues. 
</p>
<p> Oh, it was more sketchy stuff that I had to comment out. The "install" target of the Makefile had this weird line that was triggering the git issue.
