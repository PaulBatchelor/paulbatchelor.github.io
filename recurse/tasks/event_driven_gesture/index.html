<div class="comment-block">
<p>Using the trait system in place, the problem is a matter of how to build the "next" gesture. I'm thinking of implementing an event queue, possibly fixed sized. 
</p>
<p> I think the plan is to have this work in a single-threaded context first, then building abstractions around that inside of an existing event system. (in a webaudio worklet, this would wrap around the "onmessage" passing interface used).

<p>push/pop makes sense to me, but those are stack terms not queue terms. 
</p>
<p> Wikipedia tells me they use the terms "dequeue" and "enqueue". 
</p>
<p> Side note: my tired brain is having a great time parsing the "ueue"s of these words. Imagine if you pronounced it "wehweh". Hilarious.

<p>I'm kludging it into a struct with optionals for now. This doesn't spark joy. I'm going to test this well, and when/if I refactor, I can rely on these tests.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>For enqueue, I should only be passing specific data types, and then mutating the internal event array. Right now, deep copying an entire event. 
</p>
<p> For dequeue, I should either return a reference or an id that eventually resolve to a reference.
