<div class="comment-block">
<p>Using the trait system in place, the problem is a matter of how to build the "next" gesture. I'm thinking of implementing an event queue, possibly fixed sized. 
</p>
<p> I think the plan is to have this work in a single-threaded context first, then building abstractions around that inside of an existing event system. (in a webaudio worklet, this would wrap around the "onmessage" passing interface used).

<p>push/pop makes sense to me, but those are stack terms not queue terms. 
</p>
<p> Wikipedia tells me they use the terms "dequeue" and "enqueue".

<p> Side note: my tired brain is having a great time parsing the "ueue"s of these words. Imagine if you pronounced it "wehweh". Hilarious.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>For enqueue, I should only be passing specific data types, and then mutating the internal event array. Right now, deep copying an entire event. 
</p>
<p> For dequeue, I should either return a reference or an id that eventually resolve to a reference.

<p> It warps the brain, seeing all these squigglys in an editor. Like a teacher marking up an essay in red. I don't think it's actually possible to turn syntax off in nvim. The usualy "syntax off" trick doesn't work.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Behavior we want: events should only be processed at the start of a new phase. 
</p>
<p> Situation: I push an event A and call <code>preinit</code>. I then push event B, after the tick is called. What is the expected set of states for each period? 
</p>
<p> Pre-init sets things up so that our first period for sure starts with A. I believe that first tick sets things up such that the next state it is transitioning to is also A. Either that, or it is uninitialized. Not sure. Checking.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>It is eventually correct, but I have to wait about 5 samples after the first period. 
</p>
<p> Before the first tick, event A is pushed, and then preinit is called. This triggets the <code>next</code> event to happen, which dequeues the event and sets the value. 
</p>
<p> At the first tick, next vertex is called immediately. There are no values. The cached vertex is left unchanged, so it is still A. 
</p>
<p> Note to self: I am using <code>new_period</code> wrong. The timeline 
</p>
<p> Event B is pushed as an event before the next tick. It will not be read until the next period. When will the next period happen? The current phasor is currently set to have a incrementor value of 0.1, so 10 samples per period. The rate multiplier has been set to be 2/3, which is like slowing things down by a factor of 1.5. The test <b>does</b> seem to pass after about 15 samples through trial and error.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Wait are events that tell the clock to wait some number of periods before processing the next events in the queue. 
</p>
<p> A wait time of 1 will wait one whole period before allowing further events in the queue to be processed.  
</p>
<p> If I push a wait of 1, and then a scalar in the middle of period A, the start of the next period, B will dequeue the wait, and then suspend reading other events. At the next period C, there will no longer be a wait, and the next value will be set.
