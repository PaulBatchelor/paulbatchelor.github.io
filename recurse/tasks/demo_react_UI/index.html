<p>When I initially wrote this, I didn't really know what it is I was talking about. 
</p>
<p> The goal here is to be able to use a NameBrand JS Framework to get better at understanding how this tool works. I think when I initially wrote this, I was imagining React to be more of a widget library, when really it's more about managing state of the widgets, and the widgets are somewhere else.
