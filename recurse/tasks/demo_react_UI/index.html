<p>When I initially wrote this, I didn't really know what it is I was talking about. 
</p>
<p> The goal here is to be able to use a NameBrand JS Framework to get better at understanding how this tool works. I think when I initially wrote this, I was imagining React to be more of a widget library, when really it's more about managing state of the widgets, and the widgets are somewhere else. 
</p>
<p> Perhaps what I really want are some nice looking sliders with CSS, and then using React to manage the state of these?

<p>I think I know enough now to start getting the rest of this UI ported to React. I can just focus on the UI elements first, and then worry about hooking it up later.

<p>Part of my hesitation with my initial "port it to react" is: how bulky will this end up being on my website? Do I even want it there? Does it even matter if it just is code that's here in my Recurse monorepo and nowhere else?

<div class="comment-block">
<p>One of my concerns with building a react app is that if I host these on my droplet, it's going to clog things up in and take space. What I want to know is: when I go through the process of minifying and exporting the code, how much space does it end up being? What goes into uploading and running this on my webserver? 
</p>
<p> My other concern (which I'm trying not to think about too hard about) is: my website is 99% static, and introducing JS could mean adding an attack surface to my website. Probably just being paranoid.
