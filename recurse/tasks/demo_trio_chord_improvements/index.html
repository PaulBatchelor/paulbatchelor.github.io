<p>It chooses chords too quickly (when the lead changes), and should only think about changing chords when the lower/upper notes happen. I had a concept of "committing" to a chord. A faster thing might be to just move the chord changes to when the lower note triggers rather than the lead. 
</p>
<p> Also, I want tonic bias. Every 4 non-tonic chords or so, there should be a switch that puts tonic as priority, it if it is available as a candidate.
