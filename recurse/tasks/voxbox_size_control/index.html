<div class="comment-block">
<p>I think the secret to getting a better ensemble sound is going to be tuning vowel shapes for each particular voice type (soprano, alto, tenor, bass). Each of these need slightly different tract sizes. It would be very helpful if there were a way to dynamically adjust the size. No idea if this would work.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The issue with the chords at the moment is that the voice parts don't sound right, which I think is due to the shapes being wrong. If I am able to tune the size along with the shape, I think I'll end up with better sounding results.

<p>Units will be in CM, and there won't be any interpolation.

<p> I can't believe it worked haha.
