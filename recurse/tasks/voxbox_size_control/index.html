<div class="comment-block">
<p>I think the secret to getting a better ensemble sound is going to be tuning vowel shapes for each particular voice type (soprano, alto, tenor, bass). Each of these need slightly different tract sizes. It would be very helpful if there were a way to dynamically adjust the size. No idea if this would work.
