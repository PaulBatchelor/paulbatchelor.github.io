<p>I think I know about enough to get started on hacking in a sine tone into the TIC-80 sound codebase. 
</p>
<p> A sine tone is ideal because it's a pitched pure tone, and it can be easy to tell if I'm getting the buffering and sample rate correct. If I can get a sine.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>It seems like there's a ring buffer of registers, and a register holds the data for one frame of audio. A frame consists of 4 channels of sound. Each channel is represented as a 32-bit signed integer. 
</p>
<p> When the end tick function is called, it gets the current register in the ring buffer, copies the register information in memory (RAM) to that ring buffer, then copies the "pcm" and "stereo" data bits as well. The ring buffer head is then incremented, but it's inside some conditional. I can't fully grok the conditional, but it seems to be some kind of bounds checking? I'm going to ignore it mostly for now.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I've zoomed up to the top-most callback level which looks familiar enough to me. Still, it's doing stuff in a less than straight-forward way than usual. 
</p>
<p> This is the code worth digging into a bit, which is responsible for copying TIC-80 PCM data into SDL's audio buffer. I have reformatted it a bit to make it more readable. Initially, it was all on one line. 
<pre><code>*stream++ =
((u8*)tic-&gt;product.samples.buffer[
    tic-&gt;product.samples.count *
    TIC80_SAMPLESIZE -
    platform.audio.bufferRemaining--
];</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p> The <code>stream</code> variable here is a chunk of u8 vars. 
</p>
<p> The <code>TIC80_SAMPLESIZE</code> ends up being 2. This could either mean it's a stereo frame of 8-bit values, or the sample type is 16-bit and the samples are interleaved if it's stereo. Unclear. 
</p>
<p> The <code>bufferRemaining</code> variable is decreasing by 1 every sample, and being subtracted from the total number of bytes that the buffer has. This feels like a bit of round-a-about way to avoid using a for loop structure. 
</p>
<p> When the audio buffer counter goes to zero, it fills up the tic80 buffer again using <code>studio_sound</code>. It continues doing this until the SDL buffer is filled.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>There's some kind of async stuff happening I think. A tick start always follows up with a tick end, so that's being called on one thread. Meanwhile, the synth sound function can be called a few times in between these ticks. Sometimes once or twice, or not at all.

<p>There's mention of a <code>tic80_tick</code> function, but when I try to printf from it, nothing shows up.

<p> Okay found it! inside <code>gpuTick()</code> from SDL, the call chain is <code>studio_tick</code>, <code>renderStudio</code>, then calls to <code>tic_core_tick_start</code> and <code>tic_core_tick_end</code>, which makes calls to the sound tick starts and ends.

<p>It's looking to be an interesting sound problem, because the timing of sound rendering is related to the drawing callback. There's things like jitter and frame-drops. How does it handle that sort of thing? Does the so-called "blip buffer" smooth things out somehow?

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I'm not entirely convinced that DSP works at a constant samplerate, because I think the timing is controlled from the drawing function. 
</p>
<p> My belief right now is that the audio callback works by taking any samples produced since the last time it was set, and then stretching it out to fit the required number of samples needed for the host audio callback.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I was trying to describe my issue with this codebase. What makes this impenetrable is that is that the use of macros makes it very opaque. I can't simply grep or use ctags to find definitions in the codebase.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The output of <code>blip_read_samples</code> is reading a pretty constant 735 samples at a time, which is the number of samples read at 60fps. So it is actually working at the host audio rate. My timing theory is feeling a little shaky. 
</p>
<p> <code>TIC80_FRAMERATE</code> is hard coded to be 60, so it's filling the max amount. Based on the READMEs, I think it doesn't have to be? It seems like the <code>blip_buf</code> library is designed to discretize sound chips that don't necessarily have a clock. You just note the times when amplitude changes, and then it turns that into a buffer of audio samples.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>For starters: there is no <code>blip_start_frame</code>. A call to <code>blip_end_frame</code> implicitly begins a new frame. 
</p>
<p> When it is called, a constant called <code>END_TIME</code> is used. 
</p>
<p> The <code>END_TIME</code> is defined as <code>CLOCKRATE / TIC80_FRAMERATE</code>. The framerate I already knows being hardcoded as 60. What is <code>CLOCKRATE</code>, and where is it defined? 
</p>
<p> <code>CLOCKRATE</code> is defined as <code>(255<<13)</code> in <code>core.h</code>, or 2088960. I do not understand the signifigance of this value. Going to try to look up that number, as well as the hex version of <code>0x1fe000</code>.

<p>It's used in <code>runPcm</code>, there's some math done so that the loop works on a fixed PCM buffer size of <code>TIC_PCM_SIZE</code>, which is 128, but the incrementor is in these "clock units", not sample units.

<p>Whenever this is called, a new delta is added to the blip buffer (delta-encoding). This seems to basically mean, "add a sample to the resampling buffer". 
</p>
<p> called in <code>runPcm</code>. It seems to be writing PCM data (128 samples) to the blip buffer.

<p>If my intuition is understanding this correctly, I think this program takes in a pile of delta time values, and turns that into a workable buffer? I have two optional things to try. One could be: write new deltas directly to the blip. Another could be, write to the existing PCM channel. 
</p>
<p> I got noise working! But, It's stereo noise, and I was expecting mono noise. I forgot that stereo synthesize is called twice, once for each channel. 
</p>
<p> Noise is working! It is being written to the ringbuf PCM data before calls to <code>stereo_synthesize</code> are made. I'm noticing gaps in the noise when I go between the editor and the console.

<p>I get the sense that I might not be handling the data type correctly. It might be short (16-bit) ints, not 8-bit ones. A pitched square will for sure be able to figure it out.

<p>So the function <code>blip_set_rates</code> is definitely being set to be the host sample rate of 44.1kHz, however, the blip buffer gets initialized to be only a 10th of that size, making it effectively  ~4khz max. Right? And that's assuming 1 channel. There are 4 channels that need to share that buffer, so that's like 1kHz?
