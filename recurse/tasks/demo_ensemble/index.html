<p><a href="#2024_07_01_08_41" id="2024_07_01_08_41">2024-07-01 08:41</a>: added a task for ensemble demo #demo-ensemble</p>
<div class="comment-block">
<p>This will build on the vocal chords demo, and will most likely be something vaguely like Blob Opera and Choir. Slightly lower priority than <a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_poke">demo-poke</a> because that task will let me focus on details for one face and voice, which can be a helpful learning experience when I go to do the choir app.
