<p> Okay, looks like I want to implement a filter as a trait. See: &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/rust/books/rust_by_example#traits">rust/books/rust_by_example/traits</a>&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/rust/books/rust_book#traits">rust/books/rust_book/traits</a>&gt;&gt;.

<p>I want to set aside some time to actually do this right. It's not quite fitting in my head at the moment, and I need to keep moving forward. Ultimately, what we want is to be able to have a nice way to define two two types: highpass and lowpass, which are two types that use identical data structs but slightly different methods. 
</p>
<p> I imagine it'll be pretty trivial to return and refactor. So far, this has been my experience with Rust.

<p> settuptable looks good. -- rest of initializer looks good. -- tick(): I messed up most of the exp function translations. Rust has a weird notation for this. instead of <code>exp(x)</code>, rust does <code>x.exp()</code>.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I have finished porting the glottal source component of my singing synthesizer from C to Rust. It was a bit of a tedious effort, but luckily the setbacks were small. 
</p>
<p> The port can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/src/glot.rs">https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/src/glot.rs</a>. 
</p>
<p> Sample code writing to WAV file: <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/examples/glot_simple.rs">https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/examples/glot_simple.rs</a>. 
</p>
<p> This implements a glottal source model based on the one described by Hui-Ling Lu in their dissertation. It includes a version of the LF glottal flow derivative waveform model (based off an implementation by Neil Thapen of Pink Trombone), as well as a synchronous pulsed noise component for breathiness and aspiration. 
</p>
<p> On the first pass manually translating C to Rust, I ran into some issues. Most of the issues ended up being related to the way Rust handles math functions. Instead of doing something like <code>exp(x)</code> like you'd expect, Rust tends to use notation like <code>x.exp()</code>, and I messed up the notation. 
</p>
<p> By itself, the glottal source component sounds pretty unremarkable. It will need a tract filter before it starts to sound talky.
