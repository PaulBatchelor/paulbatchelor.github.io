</p>
<p> There are two kinds of references right now: zero-index and one-indexed. The one-indexed ones are used because it means 0 can be reserved for None. <code>was_used_last</code> expects a zero-indexed chord. But really, these indexes are transparent for the most part. <code>add_chord</code> returns a zero-indexed position as well. 
</p>
<p> I think it makes sense to 1-index everything because that 0 is so critical.

<p>Upper/lower voice selection is based on minimal distance from lead voice. This could also change to be based on the minimal distance from the voice it is currently at while also being above/below the lead.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The state transitions aren't shuffling through the states as well as I'd like. Also, there's too much unnecessary voice movement. 
</p>
<p> How can the system choose interesting chords and also minimize movement? 
</p>
<p> Specifically: I want the system to be introduced to the minor 4 (without resorting to randomness), and I want the voices to resolve in an expected way. 
</p>
<p> It is a constraint problem. Each voice has different behavior. 
</p>
<p> Upper voice should move as little as possible while still being above the lead voice. 
</p>
<p> Lower voice should move the minimum number of steps required to complete the chord, based on what the current upper and lead pitches are. 
</p>
<p> New heuristic idea: of the candidates, choose the least used chord so far. Probably keep a running heat map. This solves the chord selection problem, but not the voice leading issue 
</p>
<p> Another heuristic for chord selection is to find a candidate chord that requires the least amount of movement, given the current upper/lower pitches. This would require storing the current pitches of upper/lower, calculating the upper/lower pitches for each chord, and getting the combined step change for each chord. The one with the lowest score wins. 
</p>
<p> These are two different heuristics for selection, and I can imagine there would be a way to choose one over the other.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Least movement: for each candidates, get the working upper and lower notes of those chords given the current lead pitch. Get the absolute differences between those and the current lower/upper. The one with the lowest score wins. 
</p>
<p> A good hybrid could be something called "Lazy Least Used". Go for the least used, but only if the movement required is under a certain score. Otherwise, choose the one with least movement

<p>Minimal movement means lots of situations where a note stays the same.
