<div class="comment-block">
<p>What does the schema look like? What kind of information does it have? How do file names get translated into things "seen" by dagzet? How to make sure file range links go to the right place? All this and more... later...

<p>Files are stored in <code>dz_textfiles</code>. 
</p>
<p> Files given some sort of path, which can be analogous to a dagzet namespace URL. I'd probably opt to replace things like periods with underscores though. 
</p>
<p> Take something like <code>codestudy/potential/mag_sign.cpp</code>, that could a page called <code>codestudy/potential/mag_sign_cpp</code>. Some assumptions could be made that <code>codestudy/potential</code> would already exist and that <code>mag_sign_cpp</code> wouldn't be a pre-existing node. 
</p>
<p> A janet function could be written to generate the appropriate HTML given a file path. This could then be called using inline Janet, which could then be created procedurally using a script.

<p>Gosh there's so friction getting this to work cuz everything is so connected. I wanted to just write Janet code, but I needed other things, so I put it inside a placeholder org file and ran parse, but the CSS parse path is wrong.

<p>I need to point to a brand new CSS file. Overwriting the usual one isn't going to work. Stopping for now because this will require fresh thinking.
