<div class="comment-block">
<p>This thinkpad isn't fully provisioned yet. Upstream mplayer doesn't have jack support, so I need to build it from source. 
</p>
<p> I remember this taking a while. Uh, maybe I should look at other things. 
</p>
<p> Nevermind? It just finsihed as I wrote this. That's not a great sign. 
</p>
<p> Ran into build issues. Great. Downloading from git, using the APKBUILD as hints. 
</p>
<p> MPlayer is kinda SVN? But this build script is using git?

<p>Not what I wanted to do, but here we are. 
</p>
<p> Bandwidth is slow even at the hub. git feels slow too. I wonder how much faster it'd be on a newer laptop.

<p>Build time wasn't too bad, so I'm rebuilding.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Can be done with <code>apk add foo.apk</code>. I don't think I needed the <code>--allow-untrusted</code> flag because it was self-signed.
