<div class="comment-block">
<p>The initial proof-of-concept should ideally be flexible and modular. I'll want to prototype a few instruments with this thing. The inputs will be the 10 keys on my numberpad, and the XYZ inputs from the drawing pad. Realtime audio, etc.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>There is a bit of overlap here. I want the end of the "drawing tablet experiments" to have sound, and the "drawing tablet demo" to build up from that initial demo, tuning the sound better, and adding an abstraction that will make it easy to go between tablets.
