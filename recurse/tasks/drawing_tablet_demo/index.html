<p>The initial proof-of-concept should ideally be flexible and modular. I'll want to prototype a few instruments with this thing. The inputs will be the 10 keys on my numberpad, and the XYZ inputs from the drawing pad. Realtime audio, etc.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>There is a bit of overlap here. I want the end of the "drawing tablet experiments" to have sound, and the "drawing tablet demo" to build up from that initial demo, tuning the sound better, and adding an abstraction that will make it easy to go between tablets.

<p>Going to try and timebox this to just today. What I want is to get pitch snapping on x-axis, reverb and delay effects, as well as y-axis intensity control.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I think I might have nerfed the experience with the pitch quanitization to be honest. It seems like the people I showed the quantized version to used it for less time compared to when it was "fretless". People really enjoyed the fluidic expressiveness of the pitch control and getting it to emote things using just inflection. Food for thought for another demo?
