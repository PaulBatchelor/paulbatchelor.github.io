<p> Starting on my Mac. Looks like pretty typical CMake stuff. 
</p>
<p> Seems to work! now off to try Linux. 
</p>
<p> Going to try the vanilla CMake TIC80 instructions first. I don't expect it'll work and I'll need to install packages. 
</p>
<p> Holy crap, the CMake script ran without any issues. That's surprising. 
</p>
<p> Running into Makefile errors. Turning off -j flags. 
</p>
<p> "RAKE-NOTFOUND: not found": is this a ruby thing? It sounds like a ruby thing. Installed ruby-rake and mruby and then re-ran cmake. The build is moving forward. 
</p>
<p> TIC-80 seems to include most dependencies in the source directory. This probably makes the thing a bit more portable. Reminds me of how I think. 
</p>
<p> Wow! It built. It looks like there may be support for JACK via pipewire. I've never actually looked into pipewire, but if there's a way to use it with my existing JACK applications, that would be great. 
</p>
<p> Oh crap. Alpine just permanently removed jackd when I installed pipewire-jack. 
</p>
<p> Pipewire-jack research is going to be half a day of research. Going to hold off for now. Fortunately, I managed to re-install old jack. 
</p>
<p> If there is pipewire support for JACK that works with TIC-80, I'd probably want to use that to get sound working on my Linux box. Further reading &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/audio#pipewire_docs">audio/pipewire_docs</a>&gt;&gt;.
