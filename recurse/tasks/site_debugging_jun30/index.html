<p>Looks like the escape string is wrong. I am using "'" instead of """. I did this to myself when I was trying to update the SQLite generator scripts (they got stricter about single vs double qoute usage apparently. Technically, you're supposed to use single quotes only, but they used to allow both interchangeably).
