I'm not going to worry about the tag system here, that can happen later. I just want to be able to add the timestamps and messages.

<p>This would be one line. This would continue the same line because there isn't an empty line. 
</p>
<p> This would be another line. 
</p>
<p> It looks like the parser I wrote ignores the extra line breaks. Rather than try to update the parser, I'm going to say that a line "

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I should have been using an "or" operation instead of "and". Funny how I keep confusing the two. 
</p>
<p> This whole rabbit hole started because what I was calling "comment" in the time events, I called "blurb" in the dayblurb. I was accidentally trying to get a comment from a dayblurb instead of a blurb. It was returning nil, and it was still considering it valid. I had to update the conditional logic.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>In weewiki, I use <code>@!(foo "bar")!@</code> to do inline janet stuff, but in Day 3 I was using that in another context. The workaround is to put it in a code block.
