<p>What are the changes? 
</p>
<p> Talk about Recurse Center. Looking at other resumes, should go into "education section". What did I learn about? Some topics, ordered by time investment: Rust, React, Typescript, Low Level Computer Architecture, (elements of computer systems), Gameboy Development. 
</p>
<p> More notes on Boomy: "Optimized WAV file generation using X and built method for measuring throughput". Prototypes: Describe what was built, intended functionality, tools used. It's okay if they weren't actually used. 
</p>
<p> Muvik: "Designed and implemented core audiovisual rendering pipeline in C and Lua". Also include bullet for study and link to patent. 
</p>
<p> I'm not consistent about ending bullet points with a full stop.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The education section is just bullet points. Not much detail. 
</p>
<p> oh hey, it looks like I already had some details for this one. 
</p>
<p> Okay no details.
