<div class="comment-block">
<p>Dan mentioned using VSCode again, and I'm inclined to take his advice. However, before I try that, I want to see if I can get some decent LSP things working with NeoVim. Would be especially helpful if I can get it running on this Alpine thinkpad. 
</p>
<p> Found Kickstart while trying to google "typescript in neovim". This was the other thing mentioned too: <a href="https://github.com/pmizio/typescript-tools.nvim">https://github.com/pmizio/typescript-tools.nvim</a>.

<p>This is a pretty open day, so there's a chance I'll have time for this.

<p>It works!

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Key things I did to get things working: 
</p>
<p> Clone the kickstart repo to <code>~/.config/nvim</code>. That is to say, the repo becomes the folder "nvim" as your base config. Opening up nvim does the rest. 
</p>
<p> the <code>init.lua</code> file in <code>nvim</code> is chock full of comments and README stuff. I searched and skimmed around for ways to turn on <code>rust-analyzer</code> with <code>lsp-config</code>, it was a line I had to uncomment. 
</p>
<p> Also had to uncomment a line to include new plugins, like the typescript neovim plugin I found. Installing stuff through this plugin manager thing called <code>Lazy</code> is basically a matter of appending table values to the return table value in <code>lua/custom/plugins/init.lua</code>. Opening up nvim handles installing stuff. 
</p>
<p> the LSP also does autoformatting. It <b>will</b> touch your files once they are opened, so note to self be sure to commit the files before doing anything when they are opened in neovim for the first time.
