<div class="comment-block">
<p>Dan mentioned using VSCode again, and I'm inclined to take his advice. However, before I try that, I want to see if I can get some decent LSP things working with NeoVim. Would be especially helpful if I can get it running on this Alpine thinkpad.

<p> Found Kickstart while trying to google "typescript in neovim". This was the other thing mentioned too: <a href="https://github.com/pmizio/typescript-tools.nvim">https://github.com/pmizio/typescript-tools.nvim</a>.

<p>This is a pretty open day, so there's a chance I'll have time for this.
