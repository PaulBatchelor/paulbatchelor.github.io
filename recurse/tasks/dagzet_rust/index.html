<div class="comment-block">
<p>My lua implementation was always designed to just be a prototype, and nowadays it's getting quite heavy. Now that I'm a bit more familiar with the language, I don't think it'd be too difficult to build it in Rust, tbh. I think the standard library has enough rich data types that it should be pretty straightforward.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>My hope is that the lua implementatoin is trivial enough that I can bring it over to rust without too many complications. I will outline some of the broad strokes steps required to get this program up and running. 
</p>
<p> While writing these thoughts  
</p>
<p> The first thing I'll need to be able to do is read a file from disk, possibly entirely into memory. The dagzet parser works line by by line, so if there's some iterator abstraction that allows me be to do this, great. 
</p>
<p> For parsing commands, I need to be able to read the first three characters of each line to determine the command code. Commands are two characters followed by a space, with the rest of the line being being arguments. 
</p>
<p> Commands need to map to functions which can parse the argument data of that line, and potentially append or modifiy a rust data struct representing the graph being built up somehow. But, just setting up a convenient way to map commands to functions would be great. There will be quite a few, and I often find myself wanting to add more commands to meet my needs. I made use of Lua tables to create a look-up table of callbacks. Hopefully I can do a similar thing in Rust without too much fuss? 
</p>
<p> I need to be able to split data up by spaces. Lua does not have a built-in <code>split()</code> like you'd see in other languages. I'm hoping Rust standard library has one somewhere (this functionality should be standard not outsourced to a crate right? right?!) 
</p>
<p> I need a top-level data struct that can be populated with information that is parsed. I the lua implementation, I used tables: usually as a hashmap or array structure, sometimes an array of array. IIRC Rust STD has hashmaps, and vectors I think should be enough. I can't foresee too many ownership issues due to how imperative this is, but who knows. 
</p>
<p> I need to implement topological sort (Kahn's algorithm). My lua approach used node IDs instead of references, so I think this is going to be mostly Rust-friendly to port. Still, I get the feeling that I may be forgetting something that will be a pain point with Rust. 
</p>
<p> When it has been determined that the graph contains no cycles, generate the SQLite code to standard output. This seems pretty straight forward to me, more or less going through the generated struct (read-only) and printing equivalent SQLite code.

<p>My original dagzet implementation reperesents the dagzet connections as strings that are only checked at the end of parsing when all the nodes have been added. Only then does it attempt to resolve the symbols. This makes for a more permissive parser.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>This is more difficult than I expected. A connection remark needs to reference a connection (the last connection made). So, how does one reasonably accomplish this? 
</p>
<p> Since the connections are a pair, one approach is to use a 2-dimensional hashmap of values. It feels like a lot more space is used up here. It also duplicates some of the logic in the connections hashmap. 
</p>
<p> Another thing to do is to somehow reference the connection. An actual Rust memory reference could cause the borrow checker to be grumpy. Using unique ID values to reference each connection, and having that be a key in a hash table could work. This could become a bookkeeping problem if I ever added the ability to remove connections, but there are no plans to add such a feature. 
</p>
<p> Connection ID can be their position in the "connections" vector. 
</p>
<p> Since there is no way to selecting a specific connection, it is reasonable to assume that the last connection will always be implicitely be what remarks are being written to. So, the ID will always be length of the vector (minus one for the index).

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The trick here is that the connections need to be resolved, which is another step to test independently. 
</p>
<p> A connection list, after it has been verified, should be turned into an edge list. This function is still allowed to error out. This edge list then gets passed in to the cycle checker. 
</p>
<p> Note: Topsort makes use of sets that will expand and grow. I expect to dynamically generate these inside the function. 
</p>
<p> Generating an edgelist should come first. Panic on missing nodes for now. that can be fixed later. 
</p>
<p> The top-level cycle checker should be a method called <code>check_for_cycles</code>. The original implementation was able to get some information on these cycles. 
</p>
<p> Looks like the original topsort populates a "loops found" list. I will do the same, only it'll be a HashSet. On success it will return an Ok, otherwise an error code.

<p>The best thing would be to have some struct map to the <code>VALUES</code> part in an <code>INSERT</code> statement. A method on the table, such as <code>sqlize_insert</code>, could then take in a pointer to a struct implementing that row that's able to generate values.
