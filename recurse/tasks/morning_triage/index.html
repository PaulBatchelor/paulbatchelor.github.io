<div class="comment-block">
<p>I'm thinking about building a simple web demo involving 4 voices, reverb, and some buttons that allow you to switch between chords. Probably just 4 or 5 buttons with chord states. It would be cool to be able to switch out chord sounds too.

<p>I initially was going to time my morning triage stuff. But I don't think I want to do that. 
</p>
<p> Also, comments on the triage itself aren't all too helpful. I'd much rather comment on tasks themselves
