<div class="comment-block">
<p>It seems like there's a ring buffer of registers, and a register holds the data for one frame of audio. A frame consists of 4 channels of sound. Each channel is represented as a 32-bit signed integer. 
</p>
<p> When the end tick function is called, it gets the current register in the ring buffer, copies the register information in memory (RAM) to that ring buffer, then copies the "pcm" and "stereo" data bits as well. The ring buffer head is then incremented, but it's inside some conditional. I can't fully grok the conditional, but it seems to be some kind of bounds checking? I'm going to ignore it mostly for now.
