<p>Summary: The "Algorithm": there are usually 8 different kinds of things you can use to solve a given technical problem: Hash Tables, Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Depth First Search, Sorting, Dynamic Programming, Recursion. By asking about the runtime and seeing what the problem is asking for, things can usually be reduced to about 2-3 options.
