Something that involves a thing that randomly interpolates between a set of DRM shapes and is clocked by a phasor.

<p>This could also be a good pre-cursor to the shape morphing stuff, as all the code could be a bit more relaxed and inside some sample rust code.

<p>The most important thing for this demo is the vocal-like chattering. So this example will more or less aim to build the model. The new thing to try out will be morphing between DRM shapes. The critter here will be quite small, so the tract size wlil be quite small. 
</p>
<p> I will be thinking more about the design today.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The first will be a randi like module clocked with an external phasor. The second will be a phasor whose rate can be randomized every period. Together, they can build a pretty decent jitter signal. 
</p>
<p> I'll probably be extracting my LCG logic into an RNG module as well.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>An ideal jitter line would be a random line segment clocked a phasor that some kind of variable fluctuation in timing. But how does that phasor's rate get controlled? 
</p>
<p> The best answer I can come up with is to have a specialized phasor whose rate can be smoothly randomized within a range. This, combined with the random line generator made previously, would build up the components for a jitter line generator. 
</p>
<p> As a test, this random phasor could be used on the chatter test to modulate how quickly the shapes are changing.

<p>Yes, I think I'm going to call it RandomPhasor. I'm going to copy and paste the phasor code for now, since there's not a lot of code. It just doesn't seem worth it to DRY it right now.

<p>Unexpected Knowledge Acquisition: Learning about some of the old oil pipe constructions in the US, and their ecological/environmental implications. Apparently some of these pipes were transferred in carts in a way that the pipes would rub up against eachother. The friction would produce weak spots, which would turn the pipes into "swiss cheese". I just love that imagery.
