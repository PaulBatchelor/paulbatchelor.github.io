<h1>Create chatter sounds example</h1>
Something that involves a thing that randomly interpolates between a set of DRM shapes and is clocked by a phasor.

<p>This could also be a good pre-cursor to the shape morphing stuff, as all the code could be a bit more relaxed and inside some sample rust code.

<p>The most important thing for this demo is the vocal-like chattering. So this example will more or less aim to build the model. The new thing to try out will be morphing between DRM shapes. The critter here will be quite small, so the tract size wlil be quite small. 
</p>
<p> I will be thinking more about the design today.

<p>Thinking about something like randi, but phasor-driven. And a phasor that can have randomized periods.
