<h1>logs</h1>
<p>I have developed a reasonably simple
text-based log format to keep
track of what I do day-to-day. These get parsed and turned
into SQLite tables, then those tables get presented here
in HTML.

<p><div class="comment-block">I'm attempting to think up a simplified version of my zetdo system for use with RC. zetdo is built on top of weewiki/zet, which has too many intermediate parts. Ideally, I'd like to build up a simple markup that can be parsed and compiled into data for further processing later. Tasks have the following parts: a sentence describing the system, an optional description, and then a list of timestamped comments that can be arranged as a thread. Occasionally I group tasks into lists, but I haven't done anything complex enough to warrant a formal dependency system. For now, using my "descript" notation could be enough. This would allow me to easily build uniquely named blocks where each block could represent a task. > @foo-task this is a foo task > this is a foo description My timeline notation can then link to tasks using tags > @2024-05-21 > @08:48 I am writing a test comment for the foo task. #foo-task</div>

 Useful for autocomplete tags in Vim https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10789430/vims-ctrlp-autocomplete-for-identifiers-with-dash 'iskeyword+=\-' was good enough for my needs. 
 I'm realizing that I may want to spend some time getting used to how Rust is designed, instead of jumping into code (though I already have some boilerplate ready for porting DSP). I think overall things will be faster if I figure out how to think in Rust, rather than trying to apply my pre-existing notions of programming towards Rust. 
 Seems like some decent wisdom. There are many links and follow-ups, which may be worth looking at later.</div>

<p><div class="comment-block">I'm feeling a little bit bad about this, so I thought I'd write a few words on it. Firstly, I'm exhausted. The time between my last job and living situation and the start of my batch was too short. I knew this coming in. I'm adjusting to what are for me have been some huge life changes in the last week. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I think I'm also a little intimidated? Imposter syndrome, etc, etc. I've taken about a six month break from writing code. Lots of reading and research around the code. But coding itself has been fairly sparse outside of a few ad-hoc scripts. I also doubt my skills a fair bit. I really only know a modest amount of C, along with a handful of scripting languages on top of that. DSP and realtime audio puts a limit the kind of languages you get to study. Most languages used today are simply not suitable for realtime or soft realtime applications. As a result, I've never had many opportunities to work much with other languages. It's hard having that feel like the only language you feel only sort of comfortable in. I guess I wish I had more go-to "modern" languages that are less niche. I'm hoping I'll be better at getting over myself in the next few weeks.
