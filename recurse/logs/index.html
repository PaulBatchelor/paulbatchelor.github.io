<p>"cx" is an external connection, and it allows you to make connections to nodes that are external

<p> A partial implementation of cx is all that is needed for now. No aliases, no shorthands. It's all just full paths.

<p> Any nodes used by <code>cx</code> get stored in a list (set?). When unknown nodes are checked, if it can't find the node in the locally created nodes, it'll check the nodes here. 
</p>
<p> Connections will work the same way since it utilizes a SQL command. The burden is on the dagzetter to ensure that nodes get created before they are connected with <code>cx</code>. This is different from <code>co</code>, which follows a more declarative style.

<p>This one is slightly more interesting because of how the data is represented in SQLite vs how it's entered in dagzet. From a dagzet point of view, tags are a list of entries associated with a node. In SQLite, they boil down into pairs.

<p>I have the basic actions and primitives for the most part. Now, they need to be composed and worked together to trigger events for the other voices.

<p> These events need to be triggered exactly once. 
</p>
<p> Event triggers at the start of a tick. 
</p>
<p> In a test, one should be able to tick() then ask the state questions. Is the voice supposed to launch? Is it playing already? Did the voice just turn off? Is it supposed to turn off? Etc, etc. 
</p>
<p> These events need to happen exactly once. Tick, check and see if things need to be done, tick, those things are done. 
</p>
<p> prev/curr state system could probably do this? At each tick, update prev to be curr. So, that means changes and probing would have to happen together before the next tick?

<p>I was trying to figure out when to trigger certain events like gates and pitch changes. I was has having difficulty getting to the bottom of pitch changes for auto voices: when they are initially turned on (happens when the gate is first on), the pitch needs to be instantaneous, otherwise it is scheduled. How does the voice know the difference? What state information is needed?

<div class="comment-block">
<p>This is the best I got so far. 
</p>
<p> Consider the state needed to determine a pitch change for an autovoice: it happens when when the lead note is on, and the timer has reached a particular value. An extra value could be used to determine whether to immediate set or schedule based on if the voice is turned on. 
</p>
<p> An auto voice will always be immediately set to a pitch first, and would therefore set the voice flag to on. Subsequent voice changes will be scheduled until this voice flag is turned off. 
</p>
<p> The only way the voice flag is turned off is when an gate off event happens. This will turn off all the voices in the state.

<p>I'm tempted to have this be a set of state separate from the current set of state. I believe you could make the case that the flow of information is one-way: changes from the main state influence the states of the auto voices, and not the other way around.

<p> Separating state like this I think will make it easier to test.

<p> On a more personal note, Zulip is triggering some of the anxiety-induced FOMO feelings similar to the ones that prompted me to delete Facebook a decade ago. Crazy to think that even after all this time and growth, I still find myself reacting to situations in same way (how disappointing).

<p>Most of this boils down to string generation. It'd be good to have some intermediate structures before that. 
</p>
<p> Being able to generate sqlite schemas is a good start. A table as named values, each with a type. 
</p>
<p> It would be nice to have a consistent ordering of these names, for things like generating insert statements. 
</p>
<p> A table itself also has a distinct name.

<p>The best thing would be to have some struct map to the <code>VALUES</code> part in an <code>INSERT</code> statement. A method on the table, such as <code>sqlize_insert</code>, could then take in a pointer to a struct implementing that row that's able to generate values. 
</p>
<p> Trying to un-confuse myself: supposing I had table A. I'd want to make it so <code>A.sqlize_insert(row)</code> would generate an insert statement from data in row. Another table B attempting to call <code>B.sqlize_insert(row)</code> would get a compiler error due a type mismatch.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>One of the things I am doing in Trio is forcing a phase reset on pen down so the voices always stagger the same way. The funderlying rephasor in the gesture signal generator does not have a way of handling phase resets, so it'll assume a faster tempo change and cause unwanted jumps in time. The rephasor needs a way to be told that there has been a phase reset, which would cause it to skip calculating the delta time in the next sample tick. 
</p>
<p> I wonder if we can build a test around this?

<div class="comment-block">
<p>This is more difficult than I expected. A connection remark needs to reference a connection (the last connection made). So, how does one reasonably accomplish this? 
</p>
<p> Since the connections are a pair, one approach is to use a 2-dimensional hashmap of values. It feels like a lot more space is used up here. It also duplicates some of the logic in the connections hashmap. 
</p>
<p> Another thing to do is to somehow reference the connection. An actual Rust memory reference could cause the borrow checker to be grumpy. Using unique ID values to reference each connection, and having that be a key in a hash table could work. This could become a bookkeeping problem if I ever added the ability to remove connections, but there are no plans to add such a feature. 
</p>
<p> Connection ID can be their position in the "connections" vector. 
</p>
<p> Since there is no way to selecting a specific connection, it is reasonable to assume that the last connection will always be implicitely be what remarks are being written to. So, the ID will always be length of the vector (minus one for the index).

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The trick here is that the connections need to be resolved, which is another step to test independently. 
</p>
<p> A connection list, after it has been verified, should be turned into an edge list. This function is still allowed to error out. This edge list then gets passed in to the cycle checker. 
</p>
<p> Note: Topsort makes use of sets that will expand and grow. I expect to dynamically generate these inside the function. 
</p>
<p> Generating an edgelist should come first. Panic on missing nodes for now. that can be fixed later. 
</p>
<p> The top-level cycle checker should be a method called <code>check_for_cycles</code>. The original implementation was able to get some information on these cycles. 
</p>
<p> Looks like the original topsort populates a "loops found" list. I will do the same, only it'll be a HashSet. On success it will return an Ok, otherwise an error code.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Establishing a line of thought here. 
</p>
<p> A phasor reset occurs when the ramp suddenly resets back to 0 in the middle of period. 
</p>
<p> In this scenario, the reset happens as a result of an intentional interrupt. It is known precisely when this interrupt happens. The rephasor is called immediately after this interrupt. For this reason, the idea is it can be told ahead of time that the phasor reset itself, and to act occordingly. 
</p>
<p> Other than the interrupt, it is assumed that the clock is moving at a steady rate. 
</p>
<p> In order for the rephasor to handle a reset phasor properly, it must keep the overall increment amount approximately equal to the increment amount of the phasor. Any jumps indicate a failure to handle this result properly. 
</p>
<p> Assmuming rephasor scale amount is 1 (same as input), the increment of the rephasor is determined from the correction coefficient and the delta of the previous sample. 
</p>
<p> Possible solution: don't update anything with the clock reset artifact in it. Wait for it to pass through the system before updating correction and incrementor. 
</p>
<p> I think waiting two ticks should do it.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I wrote the test wrong which is why it was failing in the first place. But, now it works.

<p> I think this test might be resilient against this particular kind of reset beacuse the phase goes to exactly 0 and also that the overall slope doesn't change.

<p> No changes needed. But the test is in there to prove this.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Now, for the initial process of introducing these eventful gestures. 
</p>
<p> Before any events can be added to any gestures, we need to be able to simulate adding events. Events should only be added after the lead has held onto a pitch for one period. 
</p>
<p> The easiest way to do this using a global timer that keeps track the phasor ticks, which occur once a second. If a u32 is used, how many seconds is that? 
</p>
<p> Okay, so that's about a millenium short of 50k years. I think there's no general risk of things overflowing. I will be long dead and forgotten before that happens to a potential user. 
</p>
<p> Is this enough granularity though if I want to detect pitch changes? Maybe not actually.

<p>First, implement things so that it detects changes in pitch. Then, build a sample and hold with along with a global monotonically increasing clock that increments at the start of every tick. 
</p>
<p> Now, any time a pitch change occurs in the lead, it can be compared against the sampled pitch. If the pitch is different, but the timestamps aren't, the whole period is marked as having been changed for the rest of the period. 
</p>
<p> The "dirty bit" trick is used in situations where the pitch changes quickly inside a period.

<p>DF had a good pair of questions for me. First one was "what is NAND?" "Not AND". Follow up: "Why NAND? Why not AND?". I could not answer this well, but luckily JK was there. I am paraphrasing, but it turns out that the negation operation is important for Turing completeness. You need the negation to do things like turn a 1 to a 0.

<p> Both NAND and NOR are what are known as "universal gates", in that they can be building blocks to implement the core boolean operations like AND, OR, and NOT.

<p>It is eventually correct, but I have to wait about 5 samples after the first period.

<p> Before the first tick, event A is pushed, and then preinit is called. This triggets the <code>next</code> event to happen, which dequeues the event and sets the value. 
</p>
<p> At the first tick, next vertex is called immediately. There are no values. The cached vertex is left unchanged, so it is still A.

<p> Note to self: I am using <code>new_period</code> wrong. The timeline 
</p>
<p> Event B is pushed as an event before the next tick. It will not be read until the next period. When will the next period happen? The current phasor is currently set to have a incrementor value of 0.1, so 10 samples per period. The rate multiplier has been set to be 2/3, which is like slowing things down by a factor of 1.5.

<p>I'll briefly try to defend the notion that it was mostly a good effort. For starters, I got very a convenient linear gesture interface, which required some moderate thinking about design in rust with ownership in mind. Secondly, I got Rust code working in mnolth for the first time, and this is important because it shows that I can leverage what I've done before to boost what I'm working on right now.

<p>Using the trait system in place, the problem is a matter of how to build the "next" gesture. I'm thinking of implementing an event queue, possibly fixed sized. 
</p>
<p> I think the plan is to have this work in a single-threaded context first, then building abstractions around that inside of an existing event system. (in a webaudio worklet, this would wrap around the "onmessage" passing interface used).

<div class="comment-block">
<p>This is going to bother me if I don't write it down. I made a mention that having a buffer size of (sr/10) would effectively downsample the buffer by 10x, and this is not true. It's not true because that buffer is not filling in a second of audio, it's 1/60th of a second of audio.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I've got a linear gesture interface that works pretty well in VoxBox, and I'd like to be able to use it with mnolth. I also want to be able to populate gesture from within lua. To do this, I'll need to build out an interface in rust, export a C interface, and write some mnolth glue code (mnodes). 
</p>
<p> mainly doing this so I can compose some of this audio telephone thing using mnolth. Frankly, the Uxn thing in GestVM is a bit cumbersome.... the setup time takes too long.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>First, I'll build out the initial interface in Rust, which will wrap the existing linear gesture node with a self contained vector of paths. I'll then write some C-style functions that make it possible to do the following: initialize, append, tick, and destroy. I will make a quick example of this in Rust, which will be a good stopping point. 
</p>
<p> The next parts involve actually getting this inside of mnolth/mnodes, and creating the glue code there.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>The output of <code>blip_read_samples</code> is reading a pretty constant 735 samples at a time, which is the number of samples read at 60fps. So it is actually working at the host audio rate. My timing theory is feeling a little shaky. 
</p>
<p> <code>TIC80_FRAMERATE</code> is hard coded to be 60, so it's filling the max amount. Based on the READMEs, I think it doesn't have to be? It seems like the <code>blip_buf</code> library is designed to discretize sound chips that don't necessarily have a clock. You just note the times when amplitude changes, and then it turns that into a buffer of audio samples.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>For starters: there is no <code>blip_start_frame</code>. A call to <code>blip_end_frame</code> implicitly begins a new frame. 
</p>
<p> When it is called, a constant called <code>END_TIME</code> is used. 
</p>
<p> The <code>END_TIME</code> is defined as <code>CLOCKRATE / TIC80_FRAMERATE</code>. The framerate I already knows being hardcoded as 60. What is <code>CLOCKRATE</code>, and where is it defined? 
</p>
<p> <code>CLOCKRATE</code> is defined as <code>(255<<13)</code> in <code>core.h</code>, or 2088960. I do not understand the signifigance of this value. Going to try to look up that number, as well as the hex version of <code>0x1fe000</code>.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>If my intuition is understanding this correctly, I think this program takes in a pile of delta time values, and turns that into a workable buffer? I have two optional things to try. One could be: write new deltas directly to the blip. Another could be, write to the existing PCM channel. 
</p>
<p> I got noise working! But, It's stereo noise, and I was expecting mono noise. I forgot that stereo synthesize is called twice, once for each channel. 
</p>
<p> Noise is working! It is being written to the ringbuf PCM data before calls to <code>stereo_synthesize</code> are made. I'm noticing gaps in the noise when I go between the editor and the console.

<p>So the function <code>blip_set_rates</code> is definitely being set to be the host sample rate of 44.1kHz, however, the blip buffer gets initialized to be only a 10th of that size, making it effectively  ~4khz max. Right? And that's assuming 1 channel. There are 4 channels that need to share that buffer, so that's like 1kHz?

<div class="comment-block">
<p>My hope is that the lua implementatoin is trivial enough that I can bring it over to rust without too many complications. I will outline some of the broad strokes steps required to get this program up and running. 
</p>
<p> While writing these thoughts  
</p>
<p> The first thing I'll need to be able to do is read a file from disk, possibly entirely into memory. The dagzet parser works line by by line, so if there's some iterator abstraction that allows me be to do this, great. 
</p>
<p> For parsing commands, I need to be able to read the first three characters of each line to determine the command code. Commands are two characters followed by a space, with the rest of the line being being arguments. 
</p>
<p> Commands need to map to functions which can parse the argument data of that line, and potentially append or modifiy a rust data struct representing the graph being built up somehow. But, just setting up a convenient way to map commands to functions would be great. There will be quite a few, and I often find myself wanting to add more commands to meet my needs. I made use of Lua tables to create a look-up table of callbacks. Hopefully I can do a similar thing in Rust without too much fuss? 
</p>
<p> I need to be able to split data up by spaces. Lua does not have a built-in <code>split()</code> like you'd see in other languages. I'm hoping Rust standard library has one somewhere (this functionality should be standard not outsourced to a crate right? right?!) 
</p>
<p> I need a top-level data struct that can be populated with information that is parsed. I the lua implementation, I used tables: usually as a hashmap or array structure, sometimes an array of array. IIRC Rust STD has hashmaps, and vectors I think should be enough. I can't foresee too many ownership issues due to how imperative this is, but who knows. 
</p>
<p> I need to implement topological sort (Kahn's algorithm). My lua approach used node IDs instead of references, so I think this is going to be mostly Rust-friendly to port. Still, I get the feeling that I may be forgetting something that will be a pain point with Rust. 
</p>
<p> When it has been determined that the graph contains no cycles, generate the SQLite code to standard output. This seems pretty straight forward to me, more or less going through the generated struct (read-only) and printing equivalent SQLite code.

<p>It seems like there's a ring buffer of registers, and a register holds the data for one frame of audio. A frame consists of 4 channels of sound. Each channel is represented as a 32-bit signed integer. 
</p>
<p> When the end tick function is called, it gets the current register in the ring buffer, copies the register information in memory (RAM) to that ring buffer, then copies the "pcm" and "stereo" data bits as well. The ring buffer head is then incremented, but it's inside some conditional. I can't fully grok the conditional, but it seems to be some kind of bounds checking? I'm going to ignore it mostly for now.

<p> The <code>TIC80_SAMPLESIZE</code> ends up being 2. This could either mean it's a stereo frame of 8-bit values, or the sample type is 16-bit and the samples are interleaved if it's stereo. Unclear. 
</p>
<p> The <code>bufferRemaining</code> variable is decreasing by 1 every sample, and being subtracted from the total number of bytes that the buffer has. This feels like a bit of round-a-about way to avoid using a for loop structure. 
</p>
<p> When the audio buffer counter goes to zero, it fills up the tic80 buffer again using <code>studio_sound</code>. It continues doing this until the SDL buffer is filled.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>There's some kind of async stuff happening I think. A tick start always follows up with a tick end, so that's being called on one thread. Meanwhile, the synth sound function can be called a few times in between these ticks. Sometimes once or twice, or not at all.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>There's mention of a <code>tic80_tick</code> function, but when I try to printf from it, nothing shows up. 
</p>
<p> Okay found it! inside <code>gpuTick()</code> from SDL, the call chain is <code>studio_tick</code>, <code>renderStudio</code>, then calls to <code>tic_core_tick_start</code> and <code>tic_core_tick_end</code>, which makes calls to the sound tick starts and ends.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>It's looking to be an interesting sound problem, because the timing of sound rendering is related to the drawing callback. There's things like jitter and frame-drops. How does it handle that sort of thing? Does the so-called "blip buffer" smooth things out somehow?

<div class="comment-block">
<p>It is unclear to me when things are computing a single sample of audio (tick), and when it's writing to a buffer. 
</p>
<p> For example, SOKOL seems to be writing shorts (16-bit). 
</p>
<p> What I do know is that samples eventually show up in something called "product->samples.buffer", but I cannot find that definition yet (there's a lot of macro magic in this repo). There is also a buffer count too. It appears that these could be interleaved samples.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>As far as I can tell, <code>product.samples</code> is dynamically generated. It's not actually anywhere in a struct. The <code>tic80</code> stuct I have yet to actually find. Same goes for <code>product.samples.buffer</code> and <code>product.samples.count</code>.  
</p>
<p> There are two top audio callbacks that tell tic80 to generate soud (how much sound not sure? but it's definitely multi-channel). I'm looking at the one sokol uses called <code>studio_sound</code>. This calls <code>tic_core_synth_sound()</code>, which I assume writes to <code>product.samples.buffer</code> somehow. If I can inject an effects processor right after the buffer is fully written, I think that can be enough for me.

<p>I've been on and off about this for a few days. I think it could be a good interface to try and tune vocal synth parameters. But, I should make a decision by end of day. 
</p>
<p> Thinking about using this with my number pad, somehow. I like the minimalism of the numpad, and consider it an interesting interface challenge for the task of musical sequencing. The tablet could be a good way to get continuous fine tuned gestural control.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>How hackable is it? Is it feasible to shove my rust DSP code into the TIC80, audio callback, and control it from tic80 code? 
</p>
<p> I think this could be a fruitful way to build an ecosystem of toys that match my current aesthetic. I have semi-long term plans for this potentially. 
</p>
<p> I say "semi-potentially" because for its constraints, the software has quite a complex software stack. I don't expect this to be the most portable thing in the world. The most portable things are ideas, and after that, bytes of data (8 bits to a byte is fairly universal). There is a cartridge format, which may end up being a promising data format for portability, but we'll see.

<p> Short term (as in this batch), portability or longevity is not a concern. I just want to hack stuff.

<p>During my walk, I realized this was a perfect device for exploring vocal synthesis control. A sort of gold standard I could use to try out interface concepts before porting to the web. 
</p>
<p> I'm starting to see building instruments for the web as "redux", as far as solo interactive musical experiences go. It's incredibly convenient, but ultimately the medium of the browser is still lackluster, and usually there are tradeoffs. 
</p>
<p> Future thinking: collaboration and share-ability are the big strengths of the web. Something I haven't really explored yet. Maybe that's something to think about?

<p>I want to move forward with an ensemble demo, but coming up with the interface has been a blocker for me. I don't want to blindly recreate Blob Opera or Choir. It's been hard to see past that. How do you meaningfully control multiple voices? 
</p>
<p> Then I realized, it was never about controlling multiple voices in Blob Opera or Choir. You were always controlling one voice at a time, and the rest would follow. A leader-follower, or soloist-orchestra relationship. Such a thing I will call a "concerto" format.

<p>It's been nice getting most of my resume structured as data. It's very "music tech" oriented, with a strong emphasis on DSP and "low-level" languages like C/C++. For some reason, I didn't expect for a narrative like that to so strongly emerge. I could probably find enjoyment in "systems" oriented things: studying databases, OSes, computer architecture, etc. Rust seems like a good way to stay relevant in these fields. 
</p>
<p> I think the leetcode is going to resume next week. If I can find time every day, I could do about 30 leetcode problems before this batch is over. But, leetcode takes more time than people think. An hour of focused time is quite valuable. If I can work my way up to 2 every day, that's most of LC-75 (80%). If I do 2 every other day, and at least one every day, that's about 45, or 60% of LC-75.

<p> I want to get typescript under my belt. The handbook &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/webdev#typescript_handbook">webdev/typescript_handbook</a>&gt;&gt; is a little under 40 pages, so probably something I could feasibly read. Then again, maybe it's just good enough to throw up some sliders in React and just bump around typescript that way? How much of my time is it worth? 
</p>
<p> Maybe if I can get neovim up and running, I think I may have a better time doing webdev stuff and feeling "modern"? (He says while typing in a very vanilla vim editor in termux running on Alpine linux using vintage IBM colors.)

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Key things I did to get things working: 
</p>
<p> Clone the kickstart repo to <code>~/.config/nvim</code>. That is to say, the repo becomes the folder "nvim" as your base config. Opening up nvim does the rest. 
</p>
<p> the <code>init.lua</code> file in <code>nvim</code> is chock full of comments and README stuff. I searched and skimmed around for ways to turn on <code>rust-analyzer</code> with <code>lsp-config</code>, it was a line I had to uncomment. 
</p>
<p> Also had to uncomment a line to include new plugins, like the typescript neovim plugin I found. Installing stuff through this plugin manager thing called <code>Lazy</code> is basically a matter of appending table values to the return table value in <code>lua/custom/plugins/init.lua</code>. Opening up nvim handles installing stuff. 
</p>
<p> the LSP also does autoformatting. It <b>will</b> touch your files once they are opened, so note to self be sure to commit the files before doing anything when they are opened in neovim for the first time.

<p>The offline example should have some parts that will eventually be designed to be modulated by user input (poking). Poking can be simulating using a triggered gate. The gate would go into an envelope (envelopes?) of some sort as way to shape things like fundamental pitch and jitter.

<p> It'd be nice to get collision working for the eyes, because I think they will bulge out of the face occasionally.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Up to this point, "poking" has been simulating using a metro object. This metro needs to be pulled out of the struct, and replaced with a gate fed into a threshold generator. The metro function will exist outside, and when it ticks an impulse, it will call the poke method. The poke method will flip a gate signal on and off. Inside ChatterBox, it will detect changes in the gate and turn those into triggers like before.

<p>My lua implementation was always designed to just be a prototype, and nowadays it's getting quite heavy.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I think I know what I want in the schema, but it comes down to naming. Working out the words here. 
</p>
<p> A list belongs to a node, and has items in the list, which are other nodes in the current namespace. Each item has a position in the list, which is known. I will want these positions to be zero-indexed.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>This approach I'm using for representing lists is more SQL-y compared to say, how I'm handling <code>dz_lines</code>. I'm using more rows: each list item gets a row with a position. In theory, I should be able to reconstruct the list using some join and amalgamation operation in vanilla SQL. 
</p>
<p> By comparison, the other parts of this code represent lists as JSON arrays encoded as strings. SQLite does come with JSON bindings now by default, so it seems this is reasonably portable. But it does require that extra JSON parser, and a part of me wonders if that was the right decision. 
</p>
<p> So, consider this an experiement. I'll have both: more SQL-driven and more JSON-driven, and I'll see which one feels better over time.

<p>An ideal jitter line would be a random line segment clocked a phasor that some kind of variable fluctuation in timing. But how does that phasor's rate get controlled? 
</p>
<p> The best answer I can come up with is to have a specialized phasor whose rate can be smoothly randomized within a range. This, combined with the random line generator made previously, would build up the components for a jitter line generator. 
</p>
<p> As a test, this random phasor could be used on the chatter test to modulate how quickly the shapes are changing.

<p>The chatter sound model will feature DRM shape morphing using a pre-defined set of tract shapes. This will be a simplified version of what I'm expecting to do with the Gesture shape morphing.

<p>While populating a local copy of the edges table (to be pruned later by the topsort algo), I added a check to see if the left node id shows up in the nodes list. If it doesn't, it indicates that it is an externally linked node outside of the namespace.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>This gesture is currently hard-coded to work with floats as values. Which, most of the time, is fine. However, for shape morphing, the values that need to be interpolated aren't floating point values, but tables. 
</p>
<p> The hope with generics was to be able to elegantly use the existing linear gesture logic to create gestures that morphed between DRM shapes. 
</p>
<p> Things would be set up in such a way that when <code>tick()</code> would be called, it would know to interplate between two DRM tables and store it somewhere in another table. That table could then be taken and passed to the vocal tract.

<a href="#top">jump to top</a>
<p>41 days left of batch. 
</p>
<p> Exactly halfway now. Perfectly balanced. 
</p>
<p> Moving forward, I'm going to be reducing my check-in presence on Zulip now. I'll still post links to my daily logs, but no words until the end of the week (Friday), where I'll do a weekly digest. 
</p>
<p> I have an idea-concept for my interactions at the hub. I want to be my physically present here. Now that have this Fancy Laptop, why not try to set up a usual spot and work out in the open? The corner of the fourth floor lunch table is a strategic location. Lots of people around here, and it's also by a power outlet (may need to get extension cord). My goal is to become furniture at the hub. Be the rock in the center of the river. 
</p>
<p> Actually, what if daily check-ins could be like haikus? It's fun and creative, while also being an exercize to summarize the day. 
</p>
<p> Haiku for previous day: where did my nodes go? / investigate TIC-80 / remaining weeks planned

<p>The bundle includes the tic80 card and a wasm file. I have no idea where the wasm comes from.

<p>So, it's looking like doing any kind of hacking on this would be a fairly ambitious task that would take up most of my time. It looks like this wasm file is the only thing I have. What I'd like to do is to somehow patch it, potentially. And get it to load in custom code for audio playback.

<p> It's not a no, though it would dramatically change what it is I came here to do. Instead of doing funny vocal synth stuff, I'd be going deep into trying to reverse engineer this thing.

<p> I think if I wanted to go deep on wasm rather than frontend stacks, I'd definitely want to look into this. This stuff sparks joy more than javascript/React.

<p>I want to focus on designing more musical experiences using my vocal synthesizer, that run in the browser. 
</p>
<p> This, however, is not enough of a project, and risks being too design oriented rather than technically oriented. I am also quite seriously considering putting some work into hacking my vocal synthesis DSP written in Rust into tic80. 
</p>
<p> Why tic80? I like the aesthetic. And hacking the software's source code seems to very much be in the spirit of RC. It is also possible to export to WASM, but not with the hacks. As a stretch, it may be possible to somehow hack the wasm TIC cartridge wasm blob, or even write a custom TIC loader based on the TIC-80 codebase. 
</p>
<p> Design and presentation is still and important factor. There will be two kinds musical interactions: ensemble and solo. The main ensemble sining project will probably be something similar to blob opera. The main solo singing project will be "A Blob Named Bucket", a chittering singinig virtual pet that you have to coax out of hiding with food. 
</p>
<p> A Blob Named Bucket will be the more complicated project, requiring a procedurally generated critter generator, and a character engine simulator Bucket's behavior. For this reason, these components will be broken up into smaller self-contained demos. These need to be self contained because it's likely I may not be able to get to the final project. 
</p>
<p> The ensemble demo will probably just be for the web using p5, and will building off of the chords demo I made in the first half. 
</p>
<p> TIC-80 demos will do their best to follow some of the ideas in the p5 demos. Could be thought of as "redux" versions? I want to do my best to refine the mechanics of these demos, reduce until they are distilled into simple elegant forms of sonic interaction. 
</p>
<p> Tooling will need to be made as well. These will probably be HTML/WASM, and for practice, I will use React for these.

</p>
<p> Starting on my Mac. Looks like pretty typical CMake stuff. 
</p>
<p> Seems to work! now off to try Linux. 
</p>
<p> Going to try the vanilla CMake TIC80 instructions first. I don't expect it'll work and I'll need to install packages. 
</p>
<p> Holy crap, the CMake script ran without any issues. That's surprising. 
</p>
<p> Running into Makefile errors. Turning off -j flags. 
</p>
<p> "RAKE-NOTFOUND: not found": is this a ruby thing? It sounds like a ruby thing. Installed ruby-rake and mruby and then re-ran cmake. The build is moving forward. 
</p>
<p> TIC-80 seems to include most dependencies in the source directory. This probably makes the thing a bit more portable. Reminds me of how I think. 
</p>
<p> Wow! It built. It looks like there may be support for JACK via pipewire. I've never actually looked into pipewire, but if there's a way to use it with my existing JACK applications, that would be great. 
</p>
<p> Oh crap. Alpine just permanently removed jackd when I installed pipewire-jack. 
</p>
<p> Pipewire-jack research is going to be half a day of research. Going to hold off for now. Fortunately, I managed to re-install old jack. 
</p>
<p> If there is pipewire support for JACK that works with TIC-80, I'd probably want to use that to get sound working on my Linux box. Further reading &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/audio#pipewire_docs">audio/pipewire_docs</a>&gt;&gt;.

<p>Basically, there are default header/footer functions for HTML pages. I need to rework this so that the dagzet files use their own custom header/footer functions.

<p> Does weewiki store the current page name somewhere? Yes, it's <code>ww-name</code>. 
</p>
<p> I'm going with global mutable state, because that's ultimately going to be easier. 
</p>
<p> Oh boy, this is tricky. By the time the Org gets parsed, the headers/footers are already set up. This means I can't actually disable the templates from the Org file itself. It needs to come from a lower level. 
</p>
<p> I can add the files to a list, but that's error prone. 
</p>
<p> Okay, files are going to have the "dzfiles" or perhaps "dzf" extension for terseness. So for example, a file called <code>codestudy/potential/mag_sign.rs</code> would have a prefix of <code>dzf/codestudy/potential/mag_sign.rs</code>. My weewiki server would then be able to filter those pages and disable templates entirely. So far this is the best hack I got.

<h3><a href="#2024_06_23" id="2024_06_23">2024-06-23</a> Day 35. Sokol investigations.</h3>

<a href="#top">jump to top</a>
<p>48 Days left of batch. 
</p>
<p> Thinkpad ordered yesterday. Should be arriving by the 28th, So, I'll have about 40 days or so of use with it while I'm here. I got a quote for the m1, and it was less than I expected, so I might still do that. With the thinkpad, I'll never have any days where I'm without a portable computer. This is the important thing. 
</p>
<p> I was thinking all day about "A Blob Named Bucket", doing research on game engines and graphics libraries, and trying to get things to work on my Linux box. I think the best contender so far is Sokol. I'm hoping to do most of the game logic in Rust. A hybridized C + Rust approach may work too, if I can get it all compiled down to a wasm file working on the web.
</p>

<p> WASM builds and runs okay with emcc. I was hoping it would have had a sprite moving, but it's just projecting a static texture. 
</p>
<p> I'm starting to feel diminishing returns, as this "simple idea" might turn out to be not as simple as I thought, and might require more time/focus than I have right now.

<p>I think the sokol headers are out of date. OSX references things like cocoa, new sokol headers references metal.

<p> Nope. Fortunately, there's documentation on the build incantation used to build <code>cube-sapp.c</code> in the sokol-samples repo: 
<pre><code>cc sapp/cube-sapp.c -I ../fips-build/sokol-samples/sapp-metal-osx-make-release/sapp/ libs/sokol/sokol.m -o cube-sapp -DSOKOL_METAL -fobjc-arc -I ../sokol -I libs/ -framework Metal -framework Cocoa -framework MetalKit -framework Quartz -framework AudioToolbox</pre></code>

<p> Made a build.sh script. Still getting a lot of weird metal-related junk errors.

<p> Cracked screen update: I have an appointment tomorrow morning at the apple store. I was thinking about just getting it in and fixed right there, but now I'm thinking I'll just get a quote and sit on it some more. It's going to be a lot of money. The internet tells me it's somewhere in the ballpark of 600-700 USD. I'm starting to think about just getting a refurbished thinkpad (x390). I'm not locked into the apple ecosystem, and I don't really need a powerful laptop for my needs. Also, my m1 works just fine when plugged into an external monitor.

<p>When I initially wrote this, I didn't really know what it is I was talking about.

<p> The goal here is to be able to use a NameBrand JS Framework to get better at understanding how this tool works. I think when I initially wrote this, I was imagining React to be more of a widget library, when really it's more about managing state of the widgets, and the widgets are somewhere else. 
</p>
<p> Perhaps what I really want are some nice looking sliders with CSS, and then using React to manage the state of these?

<p>I think the secret to getting a better ensemble sound is going to be tuning vowel shapes for each particular voice type (soprano, alto, tenor, bass).

<p>60 days until EOB (end of batch).

<p> Yesterday I was very tired and out of it. I did a lot of walking over the weekend.

<p> prev: Unblock and reflect workshop, lunch with people (Next Stop Vegan Festivals), some very baby steps into a react applications. <a href="/recurse/tasks/react_tic_tac_toe">react-tic-tac-toe</a>, implemented a simple way to do preset import for singing synthesizer demo <a href="/recurse/tasks/quick_preset_export">quick-preset-export</a>. 
</p>
<p> next: impossible day! I'm currently planning on breaking my focus up into two parts. Some of my time will be spent working with Jeff B drive some of his video filter with audio. The other part of my time will be spent doing research into FPGA gaming. I'll be studying &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/FPGA#openfpga_pong">FPGA/openfpga_pong</a>&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/FPGA#another_world_5k">FPGA/another_world_5k</a>&gt;&gt;</p>

<p> So, I gotta figure out why these numbers are getting so large. In my experience, it's usually due to numbers being so small.

<p> In addition to the bare minimum tract filter processing the glottal source, I've also added some controls over vibrato, amplitude, and tract shape (for vowel morphing). I tuned the tract shapes by ear using the distinct region model.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I have finished porting the glottal source component of my singing synthesizer from C to Rust. It was a bit of a tedious effort, but luckily the setbacks were small. 
</p>
<p> The port can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/src/glot.rs">https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/src/glot.rs</a>. 
</p>
<p> Sample code writing to WAV file: <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/examples/glot_simple.rs">https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/examples/glot_simple.rs</a>. 
</p>
<p> This implements a glottal source model based on the one described by Hui-Ling Lu in their dissertation. It includes a version of the LF glottal flow derivative waveform model (based off an implementation by Neil Thapen of Pink Trombone), as well as a synchronous pulsed noise component for breathiness and aspiration. 
</p>
<p> On the first pass manually translating C to Rust, I ran into some issues. Most of the issues ended up being related to the way Rust handles math functions. Instead of doing something like <code>exp(x)</code> like you'd expect, Rust tends to use notation like <code>x.exp()</code>, and I messed up the notation. 
</p>
<p> By itself, the glottal source component sounds pretty unremarkable. It will need a tract filter before it starts to sound talky.

<p>I started with the general question "what is it that I'm trying to do here?" and worked from there. It ended up being a good way to articulate why I chose to do my singing synthesizer project. 
</p>
<p> I'm trying to find a job. I'm using my time here to diversify my skills to something less niche so I have a better time finding relevant jobs. My career up to this point has involved a lot of "legacy" systems that nobody is hiring for (unless it's a super senior position). 
</p>
<p> The project I have chosen here involves experiments in singing synthesis that run in browser. This to me has a good balance of familiarity (comfortable) and unfamiliarity (uncomfortable). Audio programming, singing synthesis, and DSP algorithms are comfortable things for me. The regions of the uncomfortale and unfamiliar lie in <b>how</b> I am doing these things. Namely, Rust (to webassembly), and just about anything related to web development. 
</p>
<p> I think my starting point is learning Rust. Even though it is quite complicated, it is the shortest distance away from my zone of familiarity, since this is where I'll be doing the audio DSP work. My first few weeks here will be spent building the core DSP kernel.

<p>Basically, wanted to see how Rust projects tend to split up components in a project (rather than one lib.rs file). 
</p>
<p> Glanced at some docs for this &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/rust#organizing_code_project_structure">rust/organizing_code_project_structure</a>&gt;&gt;, and &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/rust#bringing_paths_into_scope_use">rust/bringing_paths_into_scope_use</a>&gt;&gt;. 
</p>
<p> There doesn't seem to be any good way to have shared code in examples that isn't included in the library. Something like monowav &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/voxbox#monowav">voxbox/monowav</a>&gt;&gt; isn't something that really should be a publically available functionality, but it's really useful for rapid prototyping. It's also too small to make it a whole other project. For now, I'm just leaving it in there.

<p>Now, to tackle the file size things.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I'm attempting to think up a simplified version of my zetdo system for use with RC. zetdo is built on top of weewiki/zet, which has too many intermediate parts. Ideally, I'd like to build up a simple markup that can be parsed and compiled into data for further processing later. Tasks have the following parts: a sentence describing the system, an optional description, and then a list of timestamped comments that can be arranged as a thread. Occasionally I group tasks into lists, but I haven't done anything complex enough to warrant a formal dependency system. For now, using my "descript" notation could be enough. This would allow me to easily build uniquely named blocks where each block could represent a task. > @foo-task this is a foo task > this is a foo description My timeline notation can then link to tasks using tags > @2024-05-21 > @08:48 I am writing a test comment for the foo task. #foo-task

<p> I'm realizing that I may want to spend some time getting used to how Rust is designed, instead of jumping into code (though I already have some boilerplate ready for porting DSP). I think overall things will be faster if I figure out how to think in Rust, rather than trying to apply my pre-existing notions of programming towards Rust.

<p> Seems like some decent wisdom. There are many links and follow-ups, which may be worth looking at later.

<p>I'm feeling a little bit bad about this, so I thought I'd write a few words on it. Firstly, I'm exhausted. The time between my last job and living situation and the start of my batch was too short. I knew this coming in. I'm adjusting to what are for me have been some huge life changes in the last week. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I think I'm also a little intimidated? Imposter syndrome, etc, etc. I've taken about a six month break from writing code. Lots of reading and research around the code. But coding itself has been fairly sparse outside of a few ad-hoc scripts. I also doubt my skills a fair bit. I really only know a modest amount of C, along with a handful of scripting languages on top of that. DSP and realtime audio puts a limit the kind of languages you get to study. Most languages used today are simply not suitable for realtime or soft realtime applications. As a result, I've never had many opportunities to work much with other languages. It's hard having that feel like the only language you feel only sort of comfortable in. I guess I wish I had more go-to "modern" languages that are less niche. I'm hoping I'll be better at getting over myself in the next few weeks.
