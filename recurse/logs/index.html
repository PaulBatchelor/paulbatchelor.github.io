</p>
<p> Starting on my Mac. Looks like pretty typical CMake stuff. 
</p>
<p> Seems to work! now off to try Linux. 
</p>
<p> Going to try the vanilla CMake TIC80 instructions first. I don't expect it'll work and I'll need to install packages. 
</p>
<p> Holy crap, the CMake script ran without any issues. That's surprising. 
</p>
<p> Running into Makefile errors. Turning off -j flags. 
</p>
<p> "RAKE-NOTFOUND: not found": is this a ruby thing? It sounds like a ruby thing. Installed ruby-rake and mruby and then re-ran cmake. The build is moving forward. 
</p>
<p> TIC-80 seems to include most dependencies in the source directory. This probably makes the thing a bit more portable. Reminds me of how I think. 
</p>
<p> Wow! It built. It looks like there may be support for JACK via pipewire. I've never actually looked into pipewire, but if there's a way to use it with my existing JACK applications, that would be great. 
</p>
<p> Oh crap. Alpine just permanently removed jackd when I installed pipewire-jack. 
</p>
<p> Pipewire-jack research is going to be half a day of research. Going to hold off for now. Fortunately, I managed to re-install old jack. 
</p>
<p> If there is pipewire support for JACK that works with TIC-80, I'd probably want to use that to get sound working on my Linux box. Further reading &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/audio#pipewire_docs">audio/pipewire_docs</a>&gt;&gt;.

<p>The bundle includes the tic80 card and a wasm file. I have no idea where the wasm comes from. It's not a file included in the source, and there doesn't seem to be any clear indication where/how it is being generated. My best guess is that somewhere it gets made with emscripten because I see mentions of it when I grep for wasm-y things.

<p>So, it's looking like doing any kind of hacking on this would be a fairly ambitious task that would take up most of my time. It looks like this wasm file is the only thing I have. What I'd like to do is to somehow patch it, potentially. And get it to load in custom code for audio playback. 
</p>
<p> It's not a no, though it would dramatically change what it is I came here to do. Instead of doing funny vocal synth stuff, I'd be going deep into trying to reverse engineer this thing. Feels very much in the spirit of RC. And this is more motivating to me than more frontend-y stuff. There may be less polished things to show, though.

<p>Using this to make any sense of tic80 feels like something that would take me maybe months to a year to do maybe. Hacking the tic80 source code itself would take less time. I'd probably have better luck building my own cartridge loader.

<p>I want to focus on designing more musical experiences using my vocal synthesizer, that run in the browser. 
</p>
<p> This, however, is not enough of a project, and risks being too design oriented rather than technically oriented. I am also quite seriously considering putting some work into hacking my vocal synthesis DSP written in Rust into tic80. 
</p>
<p> Why tic80? I like the aesthetic. And hacking the software's source code seems to very much be in the spirit of RC. It is also possible to export to WASM, but not with the hacks. As a stretch, it may be possible to somehow hack the wasm TIC cartridge wasm blob, or even write a custom TIC loader based on the TIC-80 codebase. 
</p>
<p> Design and presentation is still and important factor. There will be two kinds musical interactions: ensemble and solo. The main ensemble sining project will probably be something similar to blob opera. The main solo singing project will be "A Blob Named Bucket", a chittering singinig virtual pet that you have to coax out of hiding with food. 
</p>
<p> A Blob Named Bucket will be the more complicated project, requiring a procedurally generated critter generator, and a character engine simulator Bucket's behavior. For this reason, these components will be broken up into smaller self-contained demos. These need to be self contained because it's likely I may not be able to get to the final project. 
</p>
<p> The ensemble demo will probably just be for the web using p5, and will building off of the chords demo I made in the first half. 
</p>
<p> TIC-80 demos will do their best to follow some of the ideas in the p5 demos. Could be thought of as "redux" versions? I want to do my best to refine the mechanics of these demos, reduce until they are distilled into simple elegant forms of sonic interaction. 
</p>
<p> Tooling will need to be made as well. These will probably be HTML/WASM, and for practice, I will use React for these.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Basically, there are default header/footer functions for HTML pages. I need to rework this so that the dagzet files use their own custom header/footer functions. 
</p>
<p> Does weewiki store the current page name somewhere? Yes, it's <code>ww-name</code>. 
</p>
<p> I'm going with global mutable state, because that's ultimately going to be easier. 
</p>
<p> Oh boy, this is tricky. By the time the Org gets parsed, the headers/footers are already set up. This means I can't actually disable the templates from the Org file itself. It needs to come from a lower level. 
</p>
<p> I can add the files to a list, but that's error prone. 
</p>
<p> Okay, files are going to have the "dzfiles" or perhaps "dzf" extension for terseness. So for example, a file called <code>codestudy/potential/mag_sign.rs</code> would have a prefix of <code>dzf/codestudy/potential/mag_sign.rs</code>. My weewiki server would then be able to filter those pages and disable templates entirely. So far this is the best hack I got.

<p> Thinkpad ordered yesterday. Should be arriving by the 28th, So, I'll have about 40 days or so of use with it while I'm here.

<p> I was thinking all day about "A Blob Named Bucket", doing research on game engines and graphics libraries, and trying to get things to work on my Linux box.

I was thinking about just getting it in and fixed right there, but now I'm thinking I'll just get a quote and sit on it some more. It's going to be a lot of money. The internet tells me it's somewhere in the ballpark of 600-700 USD. I'm starting to think about just getting a refurbished thinkpad (x390).

<p> prev: Initial chords demo code works in browser, needs elaboration. Also, C Creatures. I didn't get to any of the other things planned. But, I did have some nice conversations.

<p>When I initially wrote this, I didn't really know what it is I was talking about.

<p> The goal here is to be able to use a NameBrand JS Framework to get better at understanding how this tool works. I think when I initially wrote this, I was imagining React to be more of a widget library, when really it's more about managing state of the widgets, and the widgets are somewhere else. 
</p>
<p> Perhaps what I really want are some nice looking sliders with CSS, and then using React to manage the state of these?

<p>I think the secret to getting a better ensemble sound is going to be tuning vowel shapes for each particular voice type (soprano, alto, tenor, bass). Each of these need slightly different tract sizes. It would be very helpful if there were a way to dynamically adjust the size. No idea if this would work.

<p>We were struggling getting zoom to work with the iOS emulator. But our thing did technically work. Sort of felt like I made a jerk of myself in front of everyone. Oops.

<p> John Cage once asked how he felt about his audience laughing at some of his (admittedly odd) work, to which he replied "I prefer laughter to tears". No tears, only laughter. I suppose I was entertaining. So, I'll take the win.

<p>I think I am what you'd call an Introvert's Introvert. Being around people at RC is quite enjoyable, but it has been draining for me. I'm really starting to feel it. I'll need to see what I can do to find some quiet and recharge later this week. 
</p>
<p> Suddenly being around so many people after years of being around so few is an ongoing adjustment for me. Still, it is important to me that I try to push myself a bit and coax myself out of my apartment into uncomfortable situations. The people here are friendly.

<p>Above it is the computation for the left junction. I'd imagine a symmetry between them, but it is not symmetrical. The original voc source code looks like this as well. I think I may have to go back to Pink trombone and check on it. At some point. In the meantime, I've dropped a TODO.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I have finished porting the glottal source component of my singing synthesizer from C to Rust. It was a bit of a tedious effort, but luckily the setbacks were small. 
</p>
<p> The port can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/src/glot.rs">https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/src/glot.rs</a>. 
</p>
<p> Sample code writing to WAV file: <a href="https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/examples/glot_simple.rs">https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/voxbox/blob/main/examples/glot_simple.rs</a>. 
</p>
<p> This implements a glottal source model based on the one described by Hui-Ling Lu in their dissertation. It includes a version of the LF glottal flow derivative waveform model (based off an implementation by Neil Thapen of Pink Trombone), as well as a synchronous pulsed noise component for breathiness and aspiration. 
</p>
<p> On the first pass manually translating C to Rust, I ran into some issues. Most of the issues ended up being related to the way Rust handles math functions. Instead of doing something like <code>exp(x)</code> like you'd expect, Rust tends to use notation like <code>x.exp()</code>, and I messed up the notation. 
</p>
<p> By itself, the glottal source component sounds pretty unremarkable. It will need a tract filter before it starts to sound talky.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>I started with the general question "what is it that I'm trying to do here?" and worked from there. It ended up being a good way to articulate why I chose to do my singing synthesizer project. 
</p>
<p> I'm trying to find a job. I'm using my time here to diversify my skills to something less niche so I have a better time finding relevant jobs. My career up to this point has involved a lot of "legacy" systems that nobody is hiring for (unless it's a super senior position). 
</p>
<p> The project I have chosen here involves experiments in singing synthesis that run in browser. This to me has a good balance of familiarity (comfortable) and unfamiliarity (uncomfortable). Audio programming, singing synthesis, and DSP algorithms are comfortable things for me. The regions of the uncomfortale and unfamiliar lie in <b>how</b> I am doing these things. Namely, Rust (to webassembly), and just about anything related to web development. 
</p>
<p> I think my starting point is learning Rust. Even though it is quite complicated, it is the shortest distance away from my zone of familiarity, since this is where I'll be doing the audio DSP work. My first few weeks here will be spent building the core DSP kernel.

<div class="comment-block">
<p>Basically, wanted to see how Rust projects tend to split up components in a project (rather than one lib.rs file). 
</p>
<p> Glanced at some docs for this &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/rust#organizing_code_project_structure">rust/organizing_code_project_structure</a>&gt;&gt;, and &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/rust#bringing_paths_into_scope_use">rust/bringing_paths_into_scope_use</a>&gt;&gt;. 
</p>
<p> There doesn't seem to be any good way to have shared code in examples that isn't included in the library. Something like monowav &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/voxbox#monowav">voxbox/monowav</a>&gt;&gt; isn't something that really should be a publically available functionality, but it's really useful for rapid prototyping. It's also too small to make it a whole other project. For now, I'm just leaving it in there.

<p>I'm attempting to think up a simplified version of my zetdo system for use with RC. zetdo is built on top of weewiki/zet, which has too many intermediate parts. Ideally, I'd like to build up a simple markup that can be parsed and compiled into data for further processing later. Tasks have the following parts: a sentence describing the system, an optional description, and then a list of timestamped comments that can be arranged as a thread. Occasionally I group tasks into lists, but I haven't done anything complex enough to warrant a formal dependency system. For now, using my "descript" notation could be enough. This would allow me to easily build uniquely named blocks where each block could represent a task. > @foo-task this is a foo task > this is a foo description My timeline notation can then link to tasks using tags > @2024-05-21 > @08:48 I am writing a test comment for the foo task. #foo-task

</p>
<p> I'm realizing that I may want to spend some time getting used to how Rust is designed, instead of jumping into code (though I already have some boilerplate ready for porting DSP). I think overall things will be faster if I figure out how to think in Rust, rather than trying to apply my pre-existing notions of programming towards Rust. 
</p>
<p> Seems like some decent wisdom. There are many links and follow-ups, which may be worth looking at later.

<p>I'm feeling a little bit bad about this, so I thought I'd write a few words on it. Firstly, I'm exhausted. The time between my last job and living situation and the start of my batch was too short. I knew this coming in. I'm adjusting to what are for me have been some huge life changes in the last week. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I think I'm also a little intimidated? Imposter syndrome, etc, etc. I've taken about a six month break from writing code. Lots of reading and research around the code. But coding itself has been fairly sparse outside of a few ad-hoc scripts. I also doubt my skills a fair bit. I really only know a modest amount of C, along with a handful of scripting languages on top of that. DSP and realtime audio puts a limit the kind of languages you get to study. Most languages used today are simply not suitable for realtime or soft realtime applications. As a result, I've never had many opportunities to work much with other languages. It's hard having that feel like the only language you feel only sort of comfortable in. I guess I wish I had more go-to "modern" languages that are less niche. I'm hoping I'll be better at getting over myself in the next few weeks.

<p>Can I get this to build and run still? Do I understand what is happening?

<p> Do I have examples, and if I do, can I build them with Cargo? I think there's a way, and I'd like to look it up the slow way (instead of stackoverflow: find a good book online, then find it inthe book)
