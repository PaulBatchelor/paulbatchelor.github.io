<h1>The Story of My Bass</h1>
<p>(Typos and all.)
</p>
</p>

<h2>This is My Bass</h2>

<p>This is my Bass in Massachusetts on August 31st, 2024.
I asked my Dad to take this picture on my behalf so I would
have a good picture to show. "One without the creepy chair"
my Dad says.

<h2>We've been to places together</h2>


<h3>A recording studio</h3>

<p>I am 21 years old. I am playing my bass in an EPD recording studio
at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA. We are filming a promotional
video for a spectral audio effects app for the iPad.
</p>
<p>This video is on youtube, if you know where to look.

<h3>Another kind of recording studio</h3>

<p>Here I am in another recording studio of sorts. I am 22 years old,
and I am playing my bass in an abadoned train tunnel in
Boston. I am part of a team helping my friend with her final
project at Berklee: an art installation using the medium of
glass and sound, exploring themes of decay and time.
</p>
<p>This video is also on youtube, if you know where to look.

<h2>I've known my bass since before it was born</h2>

<p>I am 17 years old. I am in a small violin shop in Cambridge, England
planing wood that
would eventually turn into the neck of my bass, years later.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
</p>
<p>I'm thinking about music as a career, and
looking at music schools. "I'm not insane, only half insane",
I think to myself, and think audio engineering could be
a good compromise. I also have been making electronic music
with computers, so maybe there's something to that as well...

I am not the one in charge here. My responsibility was simple:
"You do grunt work". The one calling the shots is my Aunt Marj:

</p>

<h2>The Luthier</h2>

<p>A luthier is one who builds stringed instruments such as
violin, viola, cello, or even bass. My Aunt started making
instruments at a local violin making shop for her children
to play, but gradually started making instruments for friends
and extended family.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/recurse/my_bass/front_with_marj.jpg" alt="front with Marj">
</p>
<p>My Aunt also made me a violin, right before I dropped it
and switched to bass. She told me in no uncertain terms that
she would not be building a bass for me.
</p>

<h2>How to measure time in a violin shop</h2>

<p>Time in a violin shop is measured in shavings, one fraction
of a millimeter at a time. It is demarcated with planes,
gouges, and chisels. No power tools.

<h2>...they let me carve the scroll</h2>

<p>It turns out with the proper supervision, this is the sort
of thing that's hard to screw up.

custom built.

<h2>The Character of Wood</h2>

<p>My bass is made out of various kinds of wood, each
chosen for their particular material properties.
</p>
<p>This is the front of my bass. It is made of Spruce. Spruce is a curious
kind of wood, whose grain is a striped layer cake of very
dense material followed by a soft material with the consistency
of marshmallow. The result is a lightweight and flexible
wood. The "flappability" of Spruce is ideal for resonance
and vibration.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/recurse/my_bass/front.jpg" alt="front">
</p>
<p>This back of my bass. It is made of maple. Maple is a hard
wood. It is robust and solid. It is used for the back for
its reflective qualities.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/recurse/my_bass/back.jpg" alt="back">
</p>
<p>These are the nut and fingerboard of my bass. They are made of
Ebony. Ebony is an even harder wood than maple. It is the
traditional material used for black piano keys and fingerboards
on stringed instruments.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/recurse/my_bass/nut.jpg" alt="nut">
</p>
<p>Note the light swirls in the wood. This actually makes it
a lower quality piece of Ebony. I think it's pretty, and
we were happy to find a large enough chunk of it.

<h2>The stressful bits</h2>

<p>Note how the back is sticking up in this picture as it is
resting on the ribs. We're about to score and cut the back,
effectively cracking it a little bit.

</p>
<p>Cutting the f-holes. After all that work getting the front
right, and suddenly we had to use a saw.
</p>
<p><img src="/res/recurse/my_bass/cutting_f_holes.jpg" alt="cutting the f-holes">
</p>
<p>Bending the ribs were by far the most stressful part. It
required bending millimeter-thick strips of wood on an iron.
Cracking was a big risk, and there were no backups.
</p>

<h2>Varnishing and Departure</h2>

</p>
<p>How does one transport a Bass from England to the United
States? We decided to go by boat! My Aunt took the Queen Mary
2 from London to New York City.
