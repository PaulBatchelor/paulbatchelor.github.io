<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/tic80_sine_tone">tic80-sine-tone</a>.
</p>
<p>A sine tone signal /
writes itself to a buffer / 
after many hours
</p>
<p>It took many hours over many days, but
I finally figured out a decent entry point
to write a test sine tone to the DAC.
</p>
<p>This took much, much longer than I expected.
</p>
<p>Part of the reason this took so long was that
the engine was a little weird (but not as
weird as I initially thought). Like the rest of
the system, the TIC80 sound engine is written
like an 8-bit system, emulating how
sound chips worked at the time. To make these
chips work with modern audio systems with
high fidelity sound, a special library
is used (blip-buf), which is included in
the TIC-80 codebase. This was not an easy library
to figure out.
</p>
<p>(I should mention that the only available documentation I
had here were the code comments, which were helpful).
</p>
<p>The other reason it took so long (I'm a little
embarassed to admit this) is that I couldn't
find all the code I needed to see (I wasn't
searching in the right directory). In my hubris,
I simply declared early on that those structs were
dynamically generated with too many macros and
therefore considered "opaque". No no. It turns
out they were in fact, in a file somewhere in
one place. A lot of time was spent needlessly
black-boxing stuff to figure out what the data
was. Sigh.
