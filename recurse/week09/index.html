<h2>Saturday, July 13th</h2>

<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/tic80_sine_tone">tic80-sine-tone</a>.
</p>
<p>A sine tone signal /
writes itself to a buffer / 
after many hours
</p>
<p>It took many hours over many days, but
I finally figured out a decent entry point
to write a test sine tone to the DAC.
</p>
<p>This took much, much longer than I expected.
</p>
<p>Part of the reason this took so long was that
the engine was a little weird (but not as
weird as I initially thought). Like the rest of
the system, the TIC80 sound engine is written
like an 8-bit system, emulating how
sound chips worked at the time. To make these
chips work with modern audio systems with
high fidelity sound, a special library
is used (blip-buf), which is included in
the TIC-80 codebase. This was not an easy library
to figure out.
</p>
<p>(I should mention that the only available documentation I
had here were the code comments, which were helpful).
</p>
<p>The other reason it took so long (I'm a little
embarassed to admit this) is that I couldn't
find all the code I needed to see (I wasn't
searching in the right directory). In my hubris,
I simply declared early on that those structs were
dynamically generated with too many macros and
therefore considered "opaque". No no. It turns
out they were in fact, in a file somewhere in
one place. A lot of time was spent needlessly
black-boxing stuff to figure out what the data
was. Sigh.

<p>Wanted lines with sound /
Built the necessary tools /
Abandoned the Thought
</p>
<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/add_day_titles">add-day-titles</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/linear_gesture_interface">linear-gesture-interface</a>.
</p>
<p>Retro-actively added some titles to my <a href="/recurse/logs">logs</a>.
I feel like there's something of a narrative now.
</p>
<p>Most of yestreday was spent building a better programming
interface for signal processing algorithm I'm calling a
"linear gesture".
I was working on a composition, and I wanted to use
my Gesture algorithms to control effects like you
would an automation curve. I also wanted to use
my mnolth system, which meant I wanted to be able to
use C. But my stuff was written in Rust. So, the task
was to get some existing rust code in VoxBox working
with an existing C project. I ended up getting
sidetracked with conversatoins all day.
But, in the evening I did get it to work.
</p>
<p>I ended up not using any of the code, and basically
just submitted the raw sketch of my composition
instead. I believe there is a lesson to be learned.

<h3>Initial Unit Tests for Rust Dagzet Project</h3>

<p>It's nice to focus on non-audio problems in Rust
for change. Porting Dagzet is a nice project because
it's a program I can port incrementally one piece
at a time. Each piece has isolated behavior
that I can throw inside of a unit test. I've
been figuring out how to set up unit tests 
in Rust, and have adopted a TDD approach to
porting. It's a very satisfying process. I wish
I had more opportunities to work this way.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Event-Driven Gesture</h3>

<p>For my trio demo idea <a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_trio">demo-trio</a>,
I've been trying to imagine ways to use my
Gesture algorithm in a more interactive way. I
have come up with this notion of an "event-driven"
Gesture. So, instead of feeding it a predefined
sequence of things to play, use an event queue
and a means of sending events to it.
</p>
<p>I currently have been implementing a very basic
event queue. Fixed size pool, thread-unsafe, etc.
I've had a good time TDD-ing the core event logic,
building tests as I go to verify functionality.
</p>
<p>Big picture, I'm hoping this event-driven gesture
signal generator can be used to implement the
voice staggering effect I'm looking for in this
trio algorithm.

<p>Sounds on the gameboy /
worked in the emulator /
not on the real thing
</p>
<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/impossible_day_2">impossible-day-2</a>.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Impossible Day Task: Writing a gameboy musical instrument in assembly</h3>

<p>Another impossible day. This time, I focused on
trying to figure out how to build a musical
instrument for the gameboy using assembly.
I learned enough assembly from the tutorial
to figure out how to access the sound chip.
I managed to get a single sound working...
on the mgba emulator. The actual hardware
did not want to do sound.
</p>
<p>The rest of the sample game from the tutorial
does have sound working, so I'll need to look
into what is going on here at some point.
</p>
</p>

<h3>More Boolean Algebra in Elements of Computer Systems</h3>

<p>The last part of this chapter had the reader
implement things like AND, OR, NOT from
NAND. I could get NOT without too much trouble.
I figured out an implementation of AND, sort of
(NOT-NAND did not immediately come to mind. I
was too busy trying to find patterns in all the
cases). I struggle with OR, even after looking
at the answers. It's clear I need to build up
more intuition.
</p>

<h2>Wednesday, July 17th</h2>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_07_17">logs</a></p>
<p>event queue finished /
eventful gesture looming /
no more tic80
</p>
<p>Tasks: <a href="#">tic80-voxbox</a>, <a href="#">compeng-resources</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/event_driven_gesture">event-driven-gesture</a>, @(taskref "rust-dagzet")!@
</p>
</p>

<h3>Event Queue Finished</h3>

<p>I have been building a very simple event queue in
Rust, with the idea that it can be used in the
context of something I'm building called an
"event-driven gesture", which is an idea I had
to take my Gesture algorithm and make it controllable
through events.
</p>
<p>I believe I have implemented all the initial
features for this event queue. The functionality
and behaviors have all been worked out incrementally
using the test suite.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Eventful Gesture Looming</h3>

<p>The "event-driven gesture" is being called
"EventfulGesture" in VoxBox. This has been
built out, and seems to work as expected in
the test suite. I now need try and use this
and see if it actually works.
</p>
<p>To test this out, I'm going to have to jump
right in and start working with it in this
trio demo, using it to implement voice staggering.
</p>
</p>

<h3>no more tic80</h3>

<p>I've decided to shelve the tic80 project, despite
my investment of time into it over the last
few weeks. It just doesn't fit with what I came here
to do.
</p>
<p>Things would be different if there were an
already active interest in tic80
at RC, or my hacks could more easily work on the
web, or if it was written in a language more
people here were excited about (tic80 engine
is written in C, and it's difficult finding
enthusiasm for C here).
</p>
<p>But alas, no. None of that here. So, it's
not worth my time right now.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Computer Engineering Resources</h3>

<p>A fellow recurser has been quite generous with
their knowledge recently. After I asked them
about resources in computer engineering, they
made a whole page on it. I found some time
to look into these and add them to my Dagzet.
</p>
<p>The node on my dagzet: &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/compeng#eckman_resources">compeng/eckman_resources</a>&gt;&gt;.
Follow the child nodes to see the resources.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Dagzet in Rust continues</h3>

<p>Spent a decent chunk of time doing more work on my
Rust port of Dagzet. There are now lines and connections
working.
</p>
<p>I keep getting dazzled and distracted by all the stimulating
fanciness that is Neovim and Clippy. The colors,
animations, and the desire to unsquiggle all the squiggles
that the clippy linter makes for me. It's very districacting,
and I grew frustrated with how it hijacked my attention.
</p>
<p>I am amused that <code>:syntax off</code> doesn't actually seem to do
anything in neovim.
