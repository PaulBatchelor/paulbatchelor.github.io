<h2>Saturday, July 13th</h2>

<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/tic80_sine_tone">tic80-sine-tone</a>.
</p>
<p>A sine tone signal /
writes itself to a buffer / 
after many hours
</p>
<p>It took many hours over many days, but
I finally figured out a decent entry point
to write a test sine tone to the DAC.
</p>
<p>This took much, much longer than I expected.
</p>
<p>Part of the reason this took so long was that
the engine was a little weird (but not as
weird as I initially thought). Like the rest of
the system, the TIC80 sound engine is written
like an 8-bit system, emulating how
sound chips worked at the time. To make these
chips work with modern audio systems with
high fidelity sound, a special library
is used (blip-buf), which is included in
the TIC-80 codebase. This was not an easy library
to figure out.
</p>
<p>(I should mention that the only available documentation I
had here were the code comments, which were helpful).
</p>
<p>The other reason it took so long (I'm a little
embarassed to admit this) is that I couldn't
find all the code I needed to see (I wasn't
searching in the right directory). In my hubris,
I simply declared early on that those structs were
dynamically generated with too many macros and
therefore considered "opaque". No no. It turns
out they were in fact, in a file somewhere in
one place. A lot of time was spent needlessly
black-boxing stuff to figure out what the data
was. Sigh.

<p>Wanted lines with sound /
Built the necessary tools /
Abandoned the Thought
</p>
<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/add_day_titles">add-day-titles</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/linear_gesture_interface">linear-gesture-interface</a>.
</p>
<p>Retro-actively added some titles to my <a href="/recurse/logs">logs</a>.
I feel like there's something of a narrative now.
</p>
<p>Most of yestreday was spent building a better programming
interface for signal processing algorithm I'm calling a
"linear gesture".
I was working on a composition, and I wanted to use
my Gesture algorithms to control effects like you
would an automation curve. I also wanted to use
my mnolth system, which meant I wanted to be able to
use C. But my stuff was written in Rust. So, the task
was to get some existing rust code in VoxBox working
with an existing C project. I ended up getting
sidetracked with conversatoins all day.
But, in the evening I did get it to work.
</p>
<p>I ended up not using any of the code, and basically
just submitted the raw sketch of my composition
instead. I believe there is a lesson to be learned.

<p>gesture with events /
unit tests for rust dagzet /
bytebeat stuff part two

</p>

<h3>Initial Unit Tests for Rust Dagzet Project</h3>

<p>It's nice to focus on non-audio problems in Rust
for change. Porting Dagzet is a nice project because
it's a program I can port incrementally one piece
at a time. Each piece has isolated behavior
that I can throw inside of a unit test. I've
been figuring out how to set up unit tests 
in Rust, and have adopted a TDD approach to
porting. It's a very satisfying process. I wish
I had more opportunities to work this way.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Event-Driven Gesture</h3>

<p>For my trio demo idea <a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_trio">demo-trio</a>,
I've been trying to imagine ways to use my
Gesture algorithm in a more interactive way. I
have come up with this notion of an "event-driven"
Gesture. So, instead of feeding it a predefined
sequence of things to play, use an event queue
and a means of sending events to it.
</p>
<p>I currently have been implementing a very basic
event queue. Fixed size pool, thread-unsafe, etc.
I've had a good time TDD-ing the core event logic,
building tests as I go to verify functionality.
</p>
<p>Big picture, I'm hoping this event-driven gesture
signal generator can be used to implement the
voice staggering effect I'm looking for in this
trio algorithm.

<p>Sounds on the gameboy /
worked in the emulator /
not on the real thing
</p>
<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/impossible_day_2">impossible-day-2</a>.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Impossible Day Task: Writing a gameboy musical instrument in assembly</h3>

<p>Another impossible day. This time, I focused on
trying to figure out how to build a musical
instrument for the gameboy using assembly.
I learned enough assembly from the tutorial
to figure out how to access the sound chip.
I managed to get a single sound working...
on the mgba emulator. The actual hardware
did not want to do sound.
</p>
<p>The rest of the sample game from the tutorial
does have sound working, so I'll need to look
into what is going on here at some point.
</p>
</p>

<h3>More Boolean Algebra in Elements of Computer Systems</h3>

<p>The last part of this chapter had the reader
implement things like AND, OR, NOT from
NAND. I could get NOT without too much trouble.
I figured out an implementation of AND, sort of
(NOT-NAND did not immediately come to mind. I
was too busy trying to find patterns in all the
cases). I struggle with OR, even after looking
at the answers. It's clear I need to build up
more intuition.
