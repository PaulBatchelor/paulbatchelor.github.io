<h1>Retrospective</h1>
<p>My goal here will be to eventually say a few words on
my batch here. What I set out to do, what I did,
what I didn't do, what was easy, what was hard.
</p>
<p>Things on my mind: broken m1 screens, more rust than
expected, webaudio is still disappointing, surprise
WACOM tablets, x390 thinkpads, troubles with presenting
sound, dealing with social anxiety, "thawing" and
"rehydrating" with people again, computer engineering,
system design, on working long hours, "please interrupt",
daily haikus, daily logging, tasks, typescript, react,
javascript, poking is abuse, three-part harmony.
