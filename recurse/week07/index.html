<title>Week 7</title>
<h1>Week 7</h1>
<p>This week, I made a interactive tiny critter
that you can poke! You
can <a href="/recurse/demos/poke">play the demo here</a>.
</p>
</p>

<h2>Saturday, June 29th</h2>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_06_29">logs</a></p>
<p>Typescript and React /
Topological Sort Bugs /
Singing Quite Loudly
</p>
<p>Figured out how to setup up typescript react
project using npx, troubleshooting with nodes,
stayed late in the hub, sang half-remembered
songs and played piano.
</p>
<br>
</p>

<h2>Sunday, June 30th</h2>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_06_30">logs</a></p>
<p>The creeping answer /
Of a gigantic bug hunt: /
Check for foreign nodes.
</p>
<p>Built mplayer from source on thinkpad, attempting
to get generics in Rust working with my Gesture
Synthesizer Generator code,
finally found the reason why nodes were missing
in my knowledge graph.
</p>
<br>
</p>

<h2>Monday, July 1st</h2>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_07_01">logs</a></p>
<p>Poking Propulsion /
Works better in Chromium /
Stored State in Sliders
</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio difficulties on thinkpad,
paired with E to troubleshoot velocity,
paired with J to get poking propulsion working,
figured out how to get a p5 context,
paired with B to get a slider working in React,
some iinitial resume-ing in Markdown.
</p>
<br>
</p>

<h2>Tuesday, July 2nd</h2>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_07_02">logs</a></p>
<p>Tiny Creature Sounds /
Told Told Some People About It /
Then I learned about Zig
</p>
<p>Initial Creature Sounds (morphing a sequence of tube
shapes), Audio Chats with Dan,
Webdev Hangout (spatial audio, typescript stuff,
frog choir), tested out MIDI controller.
</p>
</p>

<h2>Wednesday, July 3rd</h2>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_07_03">logs</a></p>
<p>built jitter signals /
summer 2 conversations /
learned about old pipes
</p>
<p>implemented jitter and jitter components (RandomLine,
RandomPhasor), implemented ordered lists, lots of
conversations with the summer 2s, more resume structure
in dagzet (yak shaving), added links to <a href="/recurse/demos">demos</a> page, attempt to figure out text templates
in Go (again, more yak shaving for resume,probably not worth
my time actually).
</p>
</p>

<h2>Thursday, July 4th</h2>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_07_04">logs</a></p>
<p>sounds and visuals /
connected together for /
the poking demo
</p>
<p>Worked out poking mechanics for sound, hooked up
initial audio and sound. Chatter sound refactored
to live inside single struct (better for porting). figured out
"tap to begin" mechanic to start webaudio. Created envelope
generator, triggergate, metro.
</p>
</p>

<h2>Friday July 5th</h2>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_07_05">logs</a></p>
<p>Haiku TBD.
</p>
<p>Some more tweaks to Poke: mouth, eyes, and tuning the
chattering in the sound.
