<p>Started the day looking into c2rust. In theory, it
installing it should have been as simple as
"cargo install c2rust". But. I ran into some
snags related to CMake and LLVM.
</p>
<p>Why did I want to use c2rust? Right. Because I wanted
to automatically port libxm to rust so I could play
small music files in the browser for some of my
sound toys. Good news, this was already done
already! &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/rust/crates#xmrsplayer">rust/crates/xmrsplayer</a>&gt;&gt;.
Bad news: it didn't sound all that great: very
low amplitude, and lots of clicks. I'm willing
to believe this was due to mistakes I made, but
it's not like libxm was a perfect XM player library
to begin with.
</p>
<p>I also got sidetracked trying to
compile Bun &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/webdev#bun_js">webdev/bun_js</a>&gt;&gt; on my Alpine
machine. It was mentioned by like 3 people over
the past few days. Being a musl-based system, I couldn't
use the pre-built glibc binaries. So I rolled
up my sleeves and gave it a go at building
from source. Funniliy enough, I also ran into
CMake and LLVM problems here as well. I got
pretty far, but had to stop when there was a build
stop that required Bun in order to build Bun.
I'll just use a chroot, thanks.

<p>I changed Coax a little bit so that it goes
after the closest pellets. Very effective. I also
started playing it while listening to various
kinds of music, a sort of spotting sessions. I
really want a quirky Bossa Nova.
