<h1>Week 12</h1>

<h2>Saturday, August 3rd</h2>

<p>Logs: <a href="/recurse/logs#2024_08_03">logs</a></p>
<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/blob_coax">blob-coax</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/investigate_xmrsplayer">investigate-xmrsplayer</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/investigate_c2rust">investigate-c2rust</a>.
</p>
<p>Started the day looking into c2rust. In theory, it
installing it should have been as simple as
"cargo install c2rust". But. I ran into some
snags related to CMake and LLVM.
</p>
<p>Why did I want to use c2rust? Right. Because I wanted
to automatically port libxm to rust so I could play
small music files in the browser for some of my
sound toys. Good news, this was already done
already! &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/rust/crates#xmrsplayer">rust/crates/xmrsplayer</a>&gt;&gt;.
Bad news: it didn't sound all that great: very
low amplitude, and lots of clicks. I'm willing
to believe this was due to mistakes I made, but
it's not like libxm was a perfect XM player library
to begin with.
</p>
<p>I also got sidetracked trying to
compile Bun &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/webdev#bun_js">webdev/bun_js</a>&gt;&gt; on my Alpine
machine. It was mentioned by like 3 people over
the past few days. Being a musl-based system, I couldn't
use the pre-built glibc binaries. So I rolled
up my sleeves and gave it a go at building
from source. Funniliy enough, I also ran into
CMake and LLVM problems here as well. I got
pretty far, but had to stop when there was a build
stop that required Bun in order to build Bun.
I'll just use a chroot, thanks.
</p>
<p>I changed Coax a little bit so that it goes
after the closest pellets. Very effective. I also
started playing it while listening to various
kinds of music, a sort of spotting sessions. I
really want a quirky Bossa Nova.

<h2>Sunday, August 4th</h2>

</p>
<p>Today was spent looking
into &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/trackers#ft2play">trackers/ft2play</a>&gt;&gt;, a highly accurate
player for files made in FastTracker 2 &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/trackers#ft2_wiki">trackers/ft2_wiki</a>&gt;&gt;, known as XM modules (using the
extension .xm).  My goal was to try to get a version
of it working without the SDL dependency, so
it could be used as simple WAV file renderer for XM files.
</p>
<p>It was a very pleasant experience. 8bitbubsy designed
this codebase for people like me who wanted to
hack on it. Stripping the SDL dependency was a straightforward ordeal, and since I was only using it to make
WAV files, I could remove a lot of code.
</p>
<p>Not listed here, but late last night on a whim
I looked into Schism Tracker &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/trackers#schism">trackers/schism</a>&gt;&gt; again. For whatever reason,
it just clicked. Things felt really good. It
was able to build and run on all my nearby
devices: my m1 mac, and my thinkpad running alpine
linux and JACK. So now all of a sudden I really
want to do investigate the world of Schism Tracker
and Impulse Tracker module files (IT).

<p>Was a very "sidequest" day.
</p>
<p>Went for a walk to the park, played around with
Schismtracker with RB. They showed me some sound
design tricks.
</p>
<p>I did start some brief work on this IT parser.
I was going to just do it in C, but I reached
for Rust instead. It's nice to have an expressive
language for a change for this kind of thing.

<p>Low-energy day. Processed a lot of thoughts and
feelings.
</p>
<p>Spent the morning working on niceties. Helped
PK with some ALSA troubleshooting after the audiohang.
Got some note information to print in my IT parsing
experiments.
