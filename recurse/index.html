<h1>Paul's Recurse Personal Wiki</h1>
<p>Hello. Welcome to my Recurse Center Personal Wiki!
</p>
<p>My name is Paul (he/him). I like to make computers sing!
During my batch (Summer 1 2024),
I'll be exploring ways to get vocal synthesis working
in the web browswer.
</p>
<p>Here are some things to check out:
</p>
<p><a href="/recurse/logs">logs</a>: daily journals I make during
the day that allow me to remember what I did.
</p>
<p><a href="/recurse/dz">DAGzet</a>: a <a href="/wiki/zettelkasten">zettelkasten</a> inspired
knowledge database I have invented that allows me to structure things
as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">Directed Acyclic Graph</a>(DAG) using a markup language. The output has been HTMLized
for your viewing pleasure.
</p>
<p><a href="/recurse/taskgroups">tasks</a>: various tasks I am working on, organized
by group. It's also possible to <a href="/recurse/tasks">see all the open tasks in one page</a>.
