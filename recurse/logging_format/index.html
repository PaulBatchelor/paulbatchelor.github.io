<h1>Logging Format</h1>

<h2>Daily Logs</h2>

<p>Logs are broken up into days (see the "logs" directory
in the source).
</p>
<p>A log file could look like this:
</p>
<pre><code>@2024-06-07 Today is a Friday.
Today is Friday, and I have to go talk to people about
how this logging system works.

@09:53 Write some sample code for a log #how-logging-works
I am going to write some sample code

@09:55 Write some words about the sample code #how-logging-works

@10:04 Write words on tasks</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>A block starts with a line beginning with <code>@</code>, and
provides the day. A optional description of the day can follow.
</p>
<p>New blocks following the day with a timestamp format <code>@HH:MM</code>will show up as time entries for that day. These have
a title, and and optional description.
</p>
<p>There are also hashtags in the title like <code>#how-logging-works</code>.
This is a tag, and is used a unique ID for tasks.
</p>
<p>When a task page is made, it looks for any log entries with
hashtags reference their unique ID.
</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<p>Tasks are broken up into separate files. The filename determines
which task group a task belongs to.
</p>
<p>Transfering a task to another taskgroup is done by cutting
the text over to another file using a text editor.
</p>
<p>Here is what a task file could look like:
</p>
<pre><code>@!desc This is a task group description

@how-logging-works create personal logging presentation
Create wiki pages that describe my logging workflow
and tooling pipeline.

@publish-presentation publish presentation to website</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>The <code>@!desc</code> tag adds a description for the task group.
</p>
<p><code>@how-logging-works</code> creates a new task with the unique
task ID "how-logging-works", followed by a title.
The other lines can be used for an optional description.
</p>
