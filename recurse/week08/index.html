<title>Week 8</title>
<h1>Week 8</h1>

<h2>This week I learned...</h2>

<p>This week, I learned...
</p>
<p>... how to set up NeoVim. I got a decent setup working
using Kickstart. I got a LSP server stuff working
for Rust and Typescript.
</p>
<p>...how to use libevdev, a low-level
linux kernel library for handling input events.
I learned just enough to parse events from
3 separate drawing events. I used libevdev with
libsoundio and my VoxBox Rust vocal synthesis
DSP library to build some singing demos.
</p>
<p>...a bit more about the tic80 sound engine. TIC-80,
similar to PICO-8,
is a fantasy console that can be used to make
small games with early 8-bit console aesethetics.
I've been attempting to inject my singing DSP
code into the TIC-80 sound engine. It has been
a humbling experience. This audio system is
built quite strangely compared to other systems
I've worked with.
</p>
<p>...that NAND can be used to build AND, OR, and NOT.
I've just started reading "The Elements of Computer Systems" (AKA the nand2tetris textbook), and have been reading
the first chapter on boolean algebra and HDLs.
</p>
<p>...a little bit of TypeScript and React. Just
enough to port my first interactive singing synthesizer
demo.
</p>

</p>
</p>

<h3>Neovim setup</h3>

<p>task: <a href="/recurse/tasks/investigate_kickstart_neovim">investigate-kickstart-neovim</a>.
</p>
<p>Got a neovim setup working with kickstart,
language server works for both Rust (rust-analyzer) and
Typescript (typescript-nvim). Learned a little bit
about installing plugins with neovim.
</p>
</p>

<h3>React + Typescript: UI progress and porting webaudio bits</h3>

<p>tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_react_UI">demo-react-UI</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/how_big_are_react_apps">how-big-are-react-apps</a>.
</p>
<p>I've been trying to find excuses to learn React,
and now with suggestions from others, I'm learinng
Typescript too. So, I've been porting 
</p>
<p>Spent time writing more
abstractions to match the slider groups in 
my singer UI. Did some initial work trying to get
the webaudio JS code ported to typescript.
</p>
<p>Also, learned how to export npm projects to minified
JS. The total size of this app so far is 600kb, compared
to the 12kb for my vanilla JS demo. A little bit yikes,
but not unexpected. It is what it is.
</p>
</p>

<h3>TeX backend for resume generator</h3>

<p>I've been yak-shaving my resume by building a
new resume generator (as is tradition). I had
an older CV I wrote using plain TeX (yup, just
TeX, not LaTeX, because reasons), and used that
to build a TeX backend. Now my resume has a markdown
and TeX, and the markdown can be converted to HTML
via pandoc.

So many tablets.

</p>
<p>Borrowed two drawing tablets, managed to
get them both working on my Linux machine using
libevdev. Singing program written using a mix of
C (libevdev, libsoundio) and Rust (VoxBox).
</p>
<p>Spent way too much time trying to build a web scraper
for the LC75 list. They really don't want you
to scrape their pages! Lots of tools used in my attempts:
wget, curl, selenium, jq, w3m.
</p>
<p>More thoughts on Poke demo. Created some follow-up tasks.
</p>
<p>Paired with Dan, got the rest of the typescript react
demo working.

inside TIC-80

<h3>Throwing singing synthesizers at innocent Recursers</h3>

<p>Late morning. The first half of the day was spent
playing with my XP-Pen drawing tablet that
arrived in the mail. I got it hooked up to my
drawing synth, and had a good time getting people
to play around with it.
</p>
<p>Some good ideas presented: somehow adding ostinato
rhythms and grooves, and adding in fricatives
when when you suddenly accelerate, and also
adding virtual "bumps" in the space that cause
frications to happen.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Sine tones in TIC-80... some attempts were made</h3>

<p>Second half was spend trying
to code in a sine tone in the TIC-80 audio
system. I didn't get too far, and frankly I'm
surprised at how difficult it is to do seemingly
basic things like injecting a sine tone into
the signal path.
</p>
<p>A few difficulties in this codebase. First, the
sound engine code is designed as if it were a
low level virtual machine, which makes the code
logic a little hard to follow. Second, there
seems to be a lot of macro magic going on, so
it is difficult to trace certain definitions
in the codebase.
</p>
<p>Towards the end of my tic80 troubleshooting, I
just started putting printfs everwhere in a desperate
attempt to see something - anything really - work.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Planning: chord generation algorithms for voice</h3>

<p>Finally, I snuck in a few minutes inking down
a few more ideas about chord generation in this
ensemble interface I'm thinking about. I'm working
towards having a single voice you control the pitch
of, with two other voices automatically picking
notes to form a triad. It is my hope that,
delaying the notes chosen, otherwise known as
"staggering", will cause some interesting "in-between"
harmonies and tensions during the transitions
from one stable triad to the next.
</p>

<h3>Added a sound warning to Poke.</h3>

<p>To the person who opened my Poke demo in public
and immediately shut it off after the first
warble: I am sorry. I should have mentioned
that there was sound.
</p>
</p>

<h3>There was another attempt to get tic80 sound working</h3>

<p>I had more attempts to tic80 sound working. I found myself
going outwards in the abstraction towards the OS
audio callbacks again, and learned that my build
was using the SDL backend. I also was figuring out
more about the tic80's tick start/end mechanics,
and how it relates to the audio callback. It would
seem that because tic80's tick functions are managed
inside of the drawing thread,
audio timing is partially controlled 
by the drawing callback. Which is weird. I'm wondering
if their "blip buffer" resampling solution is somehow
involved in making this work. It's very strange
code to follow, and there seems to be a lot of
macro magic which makes it difficult to grep for
stuff.
</p>
</p>

<h3>The singing tablet proof of concept is done</h3>

<p>I basically "completed" my singing tablet demo.
I took my experiment, refactored the wrong things
(argument parser), then I refactored the right things
(pulled the message handler out into another file),
then finally added some pitch quantization, vibrato,
and reverb.
</p>
<p>I think I might have nerfed the experience
with the pitch quanitization to be honest. It
seems like the people I showed the quantized
version to used it for less time compared to
when it was "fretless". People really enjoyed
the fluidic expressiveness of the pitch control
and getting it to emote things using just
inflection. Food for thought for another demo?
</p>
</p>

<h3>Career Meetings</h3>

<p>I had my first career meeting today. They pegged
me as a systems guy, which I think is a good fit?
I do tend to think in terms of systems in my work,
and so far quite enjoy what I've been reading about.
I am rethinking my priorities slightly, and wondering
if it's worth my time to do any more with frontend
tools. I might shift my focus to more systems stuff.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Elements of Computer Systems</h3>

<p>Partially motivated by my career meeting, I started
more seriously diving into "Elements of Computer
Systems", AKA the textboook used in nand2tetris.
There is a hard copy of here at the RC library. I
do like reading on paper instead of screen.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Reaching out about Computer Engineering</h3>

<p>I pinged CE again about computer engineering stuff,
and they gave me a treasure trove of things to look at.
I am grateful for their thoughtfulness. I hope to
look dig into that in the next couple days.
</p>
</p>

<h2>Friday, July 12th</h2>

<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_07_12">logs</a></p>
<p>some zettelkastens
directed acyclic graphs,
bytebeats, and trios
</p>
<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/dagzet_rust">dagzet-rust</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_trio">demo-trio</a></p>
</p>

<h3>Porting Dagzet To Rust</h3>

<p>"dagzet" stands for Directed-Acyclic-Graph ZETtelkasten,
and it is a markup language and tool I wrote for 
myself to produce <a href="/recurse/dz">knowledge graphs</a>,
such as the one I built specifically for RC.
</p>
<p>The current implementation is written in Lua,
but I thought it would be a neat challenge
to try porting it to Rust. I spent time setting
up some scaffolding: a comprehensive plan
document for implementing, and then some initial
boilerplate.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Initial Auto-chords in my "Trio" demo</h3>

<p>I implemented some initial triad chord logic
for my "trio" demo, based on the
singing tablet experiment code I wrote earlier
this week. The voice managment logic has been moved
from the C bits of code to Rust. The goal is to look
at less C code and more Rust
