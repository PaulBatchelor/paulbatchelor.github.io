<h1>Week 8</h1>

<h2>Saturday, July 6th</h2>

<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_07_06">logs</a></p>
<p>kickstart neovim /
slider groups typescript react /
rust-analyzer
</p>
</p>

<h3>Neovim setup</h3>

<p>task: <a href="/recurse/tasks/investigate_kickstart_neovim">investigate-kickstart-neovim</a>.
</p>
<p>Got a neovim setup working with kickstart,
language server works for both Rust (rust-analyzer) and
Typescript (typescript-nvim). Learned a little bit
about installing plugins with neovim.
</p>
</p>

<h3>React + Typescript: UI progress and porting webaudio bits</h3>

<p>tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_react_UI">demo-react-UI</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/how_big_are_react_apps">how-big-are-react-apps</a>.
</p>
<p>I've been trying to find excuses to learn React,
and now with suggestions from others, I'm learinng
Typescript too. So, I've been porting 
</p>
<p>Spent time writing more
abstractions to match the slider groups in 
my singer UI. Did some initial work trying to get
the webaudio JS code ported to typescript.
</p>
<p>Also, learned how to export npm projects to minified
JS. The total size of this app so far is 600kb, compared
to the 12kb for my vanilla JS demo. A little bit yikes,
but not unexpected. It is what it is.
</p>
</p>

<h3>TeX backend for resume generator</h3>

<p>I've been yak-shaving my resume by building a
new resume generator (as is tradition). I had
an older CV I wrote using plain TeX (yup, just
TeX, not LaTeX, because reasons), and used that
to build a TeX backend. Now my resume has a markdown
and TeX, and the markdown can be converted to HTML
via pandoc.

<p>TIC-80 Sound Code /
Drawing tablets for music? /
Planning next demo.

<p>Bought a mini drawing tablet to use as a musical

<p>tic80: buffers? /
staggered voice algorithm, /
wacom tablet fun
</p>
<p>More studying of TIC-80 codebase to learn how audio
works there, talk with Chirag, parsing Wacom
Tablet events with libevdev, react reading (finished "managing state" yesterday), some planning of staggered
voice algorithm.
</p>
</p>

<h2>Tuesday, June 9th</h2>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/recurse/logs#2024_07_09">logs</a></p>
<p>Drawing tablets. Lots /
of singing drawing tablets. /
So many tablets.
</p>
<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/LC75_scraper">LC75-scraper</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_react_UI">demo-react-UI</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/drawing_tablet_experiments">drawing-tablet-experiments</a>,  <a href="/recurse/tasks/consider_poke_follow_up">consider-poke-follow-up</a> 
</p>
<p>Borrowed two drawing tablets, managed to
get them both working on my Linux machine using
libevdev. Singing program written using a mix of
C (libevdev, libsoundio) and Rust (VoxBox).
</p>
<p>Spent way too much time trying to build a web scraper
for the LC75 list. They really don't want you
to scrape their pages! Lots of tools used in my attempts:
wget, curl, selenium, jq, w3m.
</p>
<p>More thoughts on Poke demo. Created some follow-up tasks.
</p>
<p>Paired with Dan, got the rest of the typescript react
demo working.
