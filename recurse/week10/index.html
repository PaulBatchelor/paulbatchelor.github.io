<p>It was pretty much an entire day spent
on my dagzet rust port. I got loop checking
to work in the morning, and the some
initial SQLlite generation code made
later.
</p>
<p>Most of the time I think was spent trying
to be clever with Rust's type system. I
wanted there to be a way to use structs
as an intermediate representation for
a row of a particular table. You send
this row struct as an argument into
a method on a table struct, and you'd
have the type checker ensure that only
that particular kind of row works with
that particular kind of table. It was
a top-down idea, rather than a bottoms-up
one in the sense that I knew what I
wanted the programming interface to feel
like, and it was a matter of wrangling
Rust to do it for me. The solution ended up
using a combination of traits, generics,
and things called "phantom types" and  "phantom data".
