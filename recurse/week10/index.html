<p>DAG Zettelkasten /
generates database code /
more will come later
</p>
<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/dagzet_rust">dagzet-rust</a></p>
<p>It was pretty much an entire day spent
on my dagzet rust port. I got loop checking
to work in the morning, and the some
initial SQLlite generation code made
later.
</p>
<p>Most of the time I think was spent trying
to be clever with Rust's type system. I
wanted there to be a way to use structs
as an intermediate representation for
a row of a particular table. You send
this row struct as an argument into
a method on a table struct, and you'd
have the type checker ensure that only
that particular kind of row works with
that particular kind of table. It was
a top-down idea, rather than a bottoms-up
one in the sense that I knew what I
wanted the programming interface to feel
like, and it was a matter of wrangling
Rust to do it for me. The solution ended up
using a combination of traits, generics,
and things called "phantom types" and  "phantom data".
See: &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/rust#phantom_types">rust/phantom_types</a>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>@09:46 Which commands am I using in my recurse dagzet? #dagzet-rust
The goal is to get just enough working that it can replace
my RC dagzet. I believe I can do this with just some shell
scripts.

<p>I really only worked in the morning
yesterday. Managed to scope out the bare minimum
of what needs to be done in order for my dagzet
rust port to work with my existing RC knowledge
graph. It is, of course, more work than I expected
</p>

<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_trio_voice_scheduler">demo-trio-voice-scheduler</a>, <a href="/recurse/tasks/dagzet_rust">dagzet-rust</a></p>
<p>Pretty much most of my day was spent building up
a new voice scheduling system for the Trio
demo <a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_trio">demo-trio</a>. The idea was to build
a system that made it easy to simulate interactions
in a test suite to ensure that behavior in the
system was working correctly.
</p>
<p>Dan showed me Stately &lt;&lt;<a href="/recurse/dz/webdev#stately_docs">webdev/stately_docs</a>&gt;&gt;, because I mentioned
my interested in building a state machine
representing this system.
</p>
<p>Dagzet in Rust is chugging along. I didn't do
much yesterday, but I did implement the rest of
the File Range command. I still need to generate
the table for it (this should be a small task).
