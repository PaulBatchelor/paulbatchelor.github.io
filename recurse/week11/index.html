<p>More Trio work.
</p>
<p>I sketched out a new way to think about chord
changes ("committing chords") that should make
the chords more coherent.
</p>
<p>I did an initial attempt to port stuff to the web.
Got side-tracked. Attempted to use Typescript with p5.
It didn't go well. I'm going to start from scratch
(again).

</p>
<p>Spent the better part of the day just trying to
get Trio ported to the web. First time using
the Canvas API directly (insteading of using
something like p5).
</p>
<p>Lots of weird troubleshooting with WebAudio stuff.
It is a very opaque API to deal with. Also,
mobile feels like flying blind without seeing
any logs. Fortunately, Google still works well
enough to look up vague things like "why is my
pointer only moving a little bit on chrome?"

<h2>Thursday, August 1st</h2>

<p>Logs: <a href="/recurse/logs#2024_08_01">logs</a></p>
<p>Presented my "Trio" demo. Spent the day working on
that. A sound demo in front of a live audience AND
over zoom with a strict 5 minute time limit AND
slides is stressful. Even with all the prep and
sound hecks, I still ran into echoing issues which
cut precious seconds away.

<h2>Friday, August 2nd</h2>

<p>Logs: <a href="/recurse/logs#2024_08_02">logs</a></p>
<p>Tasks: <a href="/recurse/tasks/blob_coax">blob-coax</a>.
</p>
<p>A bit of an aimless day at the beginning. I was
reflecting on <a href="/recurse/tasks/demo_poke">demo-poke</a>, and
how disappointed I was in the outcome. "Poke",
as it turns out, is a terrible verb for an
experience involving an anthropomorphic blobby guy.
</p>
<p>I started working out another concept of a mechanic
where you'd be able to feed a blobby guy pellets,
and came up with the project name "coax".
