<h1>Demos</h1>
<p>A collection of web demos. TBD.
</p>
<p><a href="/recurse/demos/singer_test">singer test</a>: An initial
demo, exposing the core vocal synthesis algorithm parameters
as sliders.
</p>
<p><a href="/recurse/demos/vocal_chords">Vocal Chords</a>: Experiments
in making singing vocal ensembles. The key thing I was
exploring was getting this voices to blend. This took a
fair bit of tweaking and fine-tuning!
</p>
<p><a href="/recurse/demos/gesture_demo">Tom's Diner With Gesture Synthesis</a>: An
interactive experiment featuring Gesture synthesis, an
algorithm I developed to help me control vocal synthesis
parameters in a continuous way to produce lyrical sounding
performances.
