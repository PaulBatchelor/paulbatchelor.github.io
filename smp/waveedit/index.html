<h1>WaveEdit</h1>
<p>This will eventually be the homepage for the
waveforms I found on <a href="https://waveeditonline.com/">https://waveeditonline.com/</a>.
</p>
<p><b>[dbc8a6fc] 2021-01-03-11-11</b>: phase distortion and hard sync do not work well with these waveforms.
</p>
<p><b>[e78875d0] 2021-01-03-10-47</b>: square-y vibrato? continuous unlike the others.
</p>
<p><b>[5cc0d180] 2021-01-03-10-45</b>: this is the ZAP sample I was playing with a few days ago. it reminds me of a chirp signal, but dusty.
</p>
<p><b>[302a0987] 2021-01-03-10-44</b>: this one is squelchy, and also has an articulated note like 95c5af.
</p>
<p><b>[e4b6f6eb] 2021-01-03-10-34</b>: this is some PWM stuff, but it has an attack so it feels very loopy.
</p>
<p><b>[d1ab84e8] 2021-01-03-10-27</b>: testing out these 4 random waveforms together with tabmorf. we'll see how it goes.
</p>
<p><b>[2f9c528a] 2020-12-31-13-23</b>: they have very interesting textures, that's for sure. it might be interesting to do some morphing with them. alternatively, doing some FFT processing to shave off some of the high spectrums could make them more tonal.
</p>
<p><b>[412fbc5e] 2020-12-31-13-19</b>: these wavetables alias like crazy if you try to use them like regular wavetables. I've found they sing best at sub-audio frequencies (less than 5hz). in a way, they are more like tiny loops than wavetables.
</p>
<p><b>[5e9d6483] 2020-12-27-20-03</b>: okay. didn't actually get around to doing anything with this today. soon.
</p>
<p><b>[d5c56f0c] 2020-12-27-14-19</b>: these wavetables are so giant, they make actual make a distinct sound when you play them in audacity!
</p>
<p><b>[8fd5373f] 2020-12-27-14-17</b>: attempting to play with the ZAP waveform. this will be the first time I hear any of these.
