<h4>[2020-02-14 Fri 12:55] making filename generator</h4>

<p>This seems to have a similar format to the fmsaw
generator. So that makes things be easy.
</p>
<p>Using the ABC numbering system:
</p>
<p>A has a range of 1-9.
</p>
<p>B has  a range of 1-9, but they aren't all there all
the time. Even A values have only odd B values I think.
</p>
<p>C goes 1, 2, 4 8.
</p>
<p>Another cryptic system to decipher.
</p>

<h4>[2020-02-14 Fri 13:02] initial listening.</h4>

<p></p>
<p>111 is a bit reedy sounding, compared to the fmsaw.
</p>
<p>Crossfading between 111 211, there is a gap of silence.
Some serious phasing perhaps?
</p>
<p>I swear I can hear more fifths in 311.
</p>
<p>Thirds in 411?
</p>
<p>By 611, the tonal center becomes harder to percieve. Perhaps
the fundamental goes away?
</p>
<p>118 has vocal-like qualities at the lower to mid registers.
</p>
<p>348 sounds "dusty" to me, for some reason.
</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>


<h4>[2020-02-12 Wed 14:19] first one to try</h4>

<p>Our first dive into this. This looked the
most intersting. saw waves are good, and I think they tend
to make pretty good timbres when doing FM.
</p>
<p>The FM saw has a name format of the following:
"frctfmNNNN.wav". No idea what those numbers
could mean. But I'll write an initial filename generator
for this in scheme. <code>dir</code> is the directory/filepath of
the name, which can be an empty string "", and <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>,
and <code>c</code> are the numbers.
</p>
<p>It seems that despite the numbers being double digit,
the range is between 1 and 9.
</p>
<p>Upon first glance, it would appear that <code>a</code> has a
total of 9 values, <code>b</code> goes through 9 values, and <code>c</code>only goes through 2 values.
</p>
<p>I really need to be able to draw these waveforms to see
what they look like. I have a utility from before that
does this, but it may be nice to build something a bit
more robust. Perhaps make use of btprnt? A wav plotter
would be a very helpful tool to build for later.
</p>

<h4>[2020-02-12 Wed 14:48] initial impressions</h4>

<p>I have created an initial file loader, and have put them
in the XY instrument. I am using the <code>frctfmsaw</code> shortcut
there, so I'll be talking about waveforms using the triplets
found there.
</p>
<p>the wave found at <code>1 1 1</code> is a super massive sound at the
low end. Comparatively <code>5 1 1</code> has a distinct major third,
and the low end goes away.
</p>
<p>Could relate to over tones?
</p>
<p>Going from <code>1 1 1</code> to <code>1 5 1</code> does not sound as dramatic.
Nor does <code>1 1 1</code> to <code>1 1 2</code>. Perhaps there is something
happening visually that is more dramatic?
</p>
<p><code>8 3 1</code> is a pretty crazy sounding triplet. Probably because
it starts at a higher harmonic.
</p>
<p>As expected, a good deal amount of aliasing. As the numbers
increase more aliasing happens. <code>1 1 1</code> actually isn't too
bad.
</p>

<h4>[2020-02-14 Fri 12:53] 192 is noiser than 191</h4>

<p>Not sure what that means. Again, I think more information
can be found visually. Working on a portable solution in
btprnt.
</p>
