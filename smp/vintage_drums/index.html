<title>Vintage Drums</title>
<h1>Vintage Drums</h1>
<p>A big folder of vintage drum samples I've had forever,
but have never used. Hoping to fix that.
</p>
<p><b>[f2c67f24] 2021-11-16-09-35</b>: a very tinny, very small, metal thingy. it's like hitting a tiny metal pan.
</p>
<p><b>[765699aa] 2021-11-16-09-34</b>: kind of a kick, kind of a very low tom. it's got this noisy chiff to it, which is different from the more clicky transients that come with drums.
</p>
<p><b>[84973078] 2021-11-16-09-32</b>: a snare with a solid body to it. kind of reminds me of hitting a tennis ball in a big space. maybe a bit higher.
</p>
<p><b>[26e23c23] 2021-11-16-09-31</b>: a very strange whirring sound. it's a very short upwards sounding pitch. not really something I'd associate with any kind of drum.
</p>
<p><b>[302ce3d4] 2021-11-14-17-01</b>: sounds like a balloon pop!
</p>
<p><b>[eaecb313] 2021-11-14-17-00</b>: a very synthesized sounding tom. very sinusoidal. could almost be a kick, but it's a very gentle and pitched.
</p>
<p><b>[6df5ef07] 2021-11-14-16-58</b>: a very large, very deliberately struck, tom.
</p>
<p><b>[39dd4bb9] 2021-11-14-16-23</b>: this is a long pad sample. it has a resonant filter swell, that excites the harmonics of the overtone series. It's not all that compelling to me.
</p>
<p><b>[c12286f4] 2021-11-14-09-47</b>: this isn't exactly a snare. it's more like a tiny tom-tom. I think I heard it in some reggae music? need to look up what it is called.
</p>
<p><b>[3de122e4] 2021-11-14-09-41</b>: a very tight sounding snare. more on the realistic end than the synthetic end.
</p>
<p><b>[d97307d2] 2021-11-14-09-40</b>: a cowbell. pretty short decay. almost sounds choked.
</p>
<p><b>[a3ee08c6] 2021-11-12-20-30</b>: deciding not to use this. less is more, and I like the sparse mix.
</p>
<p><b>[8e1c43e0] 2021-11-12-15-39</b>: they call it a tom, but it's noisy enough to be a weird snare. it's got some sort of phaser on it, which gives it some neat dirt.
</p>
<p><b>[73404ec8] 2021-11-12-15-37</b>: great. another crash cymbol sound.
</p>
<p><b>[8c20a9ff] 2021-11-12-15-35</b>: this is a very never-gonna-give-you-up sounding tom. I've been keen on pitch shifting, this might have some power as a bass drum.
</p>
<p><b>[a138af68] 2021-11-11-12-41</b>: pretty typical white noise snare. lots of shake in this snare.
</p>
<p><b>[c3fefa22] 2021-11-11-12-39</b>: it's a clap. very tight. a hint of room?
</p>
<p><b>[6ec4fd13] 2021-11-11-12-38</b>: this is kind of a weak kick with a pronounced click to it.
</p>
<p><b>[76729ab3] 2021-11-11-12-37</b>: this is a click, and not much else, coming from my tiny speaker. There may be sub freqs.
</p>
<p><b>[518ad0ff] 2021-11-09-09-36</b>: a very nice gentle bop. definitely pitched, basically sinusoidal. I like the attack of it.
</p>
<p><b>[00239360] 2021-11-09-09-33</b>: this is some kind of strange hihat sound. high frequency. going to be used for 'restful' novembeat prompt, so I'm thinking this fits in as a kind of desert sound.
</p>
<p><b>[881daafe] 2021-11-09-09-28</b>: this is like a tom? it has a lot of rattle to it like a snare. very synthy. there's that cheap-sounding downwards frequency drop.
</p>
<p><b>[f5957e5a] 2021-11-09-09-26</b>: kind of a wood blocky sound?
</p>
<p><b>[a0ec82d2] 2021-11-08-09-56</b>: pretty dark sounding snare. fair bit of room tone.
</p>
<p><b>[102a7302] 2021-11-08-09-54</b>: a cowbell! haven't run into many of these, so this is a fun trinket. it's more of a higher-pitched smaller cowbell I think?
</p>
<p><b>[96225619] 2021-11-08-09-52</b>: they call this a tambourine roll. I'm almost getting a cricket/insect vibe from it. which is good for the theme of novembeat today: floral.
</p>
<p><b>[522f81a4] 2021-11-08-09-50</b>: a very meek and ringy snare.
</p>
<p><b>[3b6dc4a8] 2021-11-07-09-40</b>: this tom has punch! it's very big. in novembeat, I'm using this without the other toms which may be taking it out of context. May have to group these together more frequently.
</p>
<p><b>[fafa617e] 2021-11-07-09-37</b>: this is a weird one. I love it. they are calling it a "bamboo" snare drum? it's this sorta quiet thing that is vaguely snare like. very lo-fi and interesting. I can't wait to try and use this in a mix somewhere to see how it behaves.
</p>
<p><b>[033fad8e] 2021-11-07-09-32</b>: this is a snare that very much wants to be a kick. it's got a beefy roundness to it. it also has a very short release.
</p>
<p><b>[4f6f9d8d] 2021-11-07-09-30</b>: this is a very short ride. sounds abruptly cut.
</p>
<p><b>[e6ee63c3] 2021-11-06-12-04</b>: this is like a clave or something? very synthetic.
</p>
<p><b>[13751644] 2021-11-06-12-03</b>: I'm not sure how to use crashes as they are to be honest. they just sound so cheesy. this one makes me think of a circus. I have this urge to reverse, pitch shift, and do other processing to it to make it tolerable to listen to.
</p>
<p><b>[777c5af6] 2021-11-06-07-22</b>: as the filename suggests, a gated rimshot, a distinct 80s flavor.
</p>
<p><b>[0fd47734] 2021-11-06-07-21</b>: This is a gated snare sound. Very 80s. There's a big space behind that snare, being snuffed out.
</p>
<p><b>[b458b8b2] 2021-11-06-07-19</b>: I think they are calling this a "wet" bass drum. I can almost hear why. There does seem to be a little bit of room here.
</p>
<p><b>[9b593dcb] 2021-11-06-07-18</b>: I did not actually end up using this.
</p>
<p><b>[d7edc8a2] 2021-11-06-07-17</b>: a very vintage sounding electric mid tom. It's almost begging for sibling toms to play along.
</p>
<p><b>[0794cfee] 2021-11-06-07-16</b>: realistic rimshot sound. nothing terribly distinct.
</p>
<p><b>[2ba0020f] 2021-11-05-09-58</b>: not much to say on this snare really. 808, part of the kit I was using in novembeat 4. there were quite a few to choose from, but this one was gentler, with not too much body, and a little bit of low thud. I really wanted the entire kit to feel small and off to the side.
</p>
<p><b>[62a1d2ca] 2021-11-05-09-53</b>: this is an 808 shaker that was part of the kit used in loop4. don't have much to say on this precise shaker because I haven't used these much. but it it was a really helpful layer to add to the mix to reinforce the 7/8 meters.
</p>
<p><b>[f0417f31] 2021-11-05-09-49</b>: this is presumably sampled from a real 808, so this rim definitely carries some nostalgic or 'classical' weight. definitely artificial, but not in your face about it.
</p>
<p><b>[437004e4] 2021-11-05-09-41</b>: a very gentle, subdued kick. pretty much melts and disappeared into the mix. it has a very different energy from the more forceful hard kicks I am used to working with. nice change of pace.
</p>
<p><b>[1667d566] 2021-11-04-09-35</b>: using this in days 2 and 3 of novembeat, I found that this ride had a really weird ringing to it. It was a bit annoying. I ended up putting this really low in the mix. Layered with other things it wasn't too bad.
</p>
<p><b>[9375156a] 2021-11-02-09-53</b>: thinking about using the LinnLinn-9000 drum samples today.
</p>
<p><b>[17341d9f] 2021-11-02-09-37</b>: The KawaiR50 was used for this beat. This has a very mechanical sound that I struggled with at first. It wasn't until I started making things faster an added velocity and ghost notes that things felt a little bit better. Also added some random pitch shifting too cuz why not it's there.
</p>
<p><b>[1f71c266] 2021-11-02-09-10</b>: decided to dig up samples from this folder. I ended up zapping my drive in the process. BUT I had backups.
