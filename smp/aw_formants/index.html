<h1>Formants</h1>
<p>This to be a page about formant based waveforms.
</p>

<h2>formants.scm</h2>

<p><code>formants.scm</code> is a scheme used to help generate waveform
filenames for the formant waveforms.

<h2>sine-based formants</h2>


<h3>filename generator</h3>

<p>All sinusoidal formants are in the folder <code>formants_sine</code>,
and have the format <code>formants_sine/formant_DD.wav</code>, where
"DD" is a number between 1 and 16 (inclusive).
</p>
<p>The function <code>formants-fname-sine</code> will produce a filename,
given a number.
</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be any formatted printing facilities
built into s9 scheme, so I hacked in some zero leftpadding.
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;top&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>(define (formants-fname-sine num)
  (let
      ((mknum
        (lambda (n)
          (if (&gt;= n 10)
              (number-&gt;string n)
              (begin
                (string-append "0" (number-&gt;string n)))))))
    (begin
      (string-append
       "formants_sine/formant_"
       (mknum num)
       ".wav"))))</pre></code>

<h3>observations</h3>


<h4>[2020-01-21 Tue 11:22] initial observations</h4>

<p>I just got my XY pad instrument set up and loading these
wavetables from SQLar. It sounds like they may be ordered
based on number of harmonics or range of harmonics.
</p>
<p>1 felt pretty subtractive saw-y, as does 2.
</p>
<p>3 begin sounding vocal-like. I could move the XY pad
oscillator and to make it say "WOW".
</p>
<p>I jumped to 16, and it had a lot of high frequency content
that could only be appreciated with really low sounds
(MIDI 24), and audible aliasing occured in the upper
frequencies.
</p>
<p>A part of me thinks it would be worthwhile to build a
morphing oscillator of 2-3 oscillators using Y for
position. Would be a good way to compare wavetable
spectrums relative to one another. I get the sense that
the true magic of this formant wavetable set is from
blending them together in this fashion.
</p>

<h2>non-sine based formants</h2>


<h3>filename generator</h3>

<p>non-sine filenames are a bit more complicated than sine. In
addition to the number, there's also a waveform time, which
can be one of saw, square, or triangle.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;top&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>(define (formants-fname-nonsine type num)
  (let
      ((mknum
        (lambda (n)
          (if (&gt;= n 10)
              (number-&gt;string n)
              (begin
                (string-append "0" (number-&gt;string n)))))))
    (begin
      (string-append
       "formants_nonsine/formant_"
       type "_"
       (mknum num)
       ".wav"))))</pre></code>

<h3>observations</h3>


<h4>[2020-01-21 Tue 13:48]</h4>

<p>initial thoughts.
</p>
<p>like sine, higher the number, the brighter things tend to
be. These are all very bright and alias very quickly.
</p>
<p>The saws have a pretty massive sound for one oscillator.
At 4, things sound very bright and high pitched, despite
the NN being low.
</p>
<p>The squares sound have more vocal qualities than the saw,
which doesn't really surprise me considering how the square
approximates the glottis. I was testing at 4.
</p>
<p>The triangle unsurprisingly sounds most similar to the
sinewaves. I wiggled the triangle around and it has more
of a critter-like quality to it at 16. Sines are more
subdued, have bottom.
</p>
<p>sine at formant 2 sounds FM-y, while triangle sounds
more reedy.
</p>

<h2>Formant Combinations</h2>

<p>Load some combinations of formants into wavetables. Write
some observations.
</p>

<h3>Combo0</h3>

<p>Initially created: [2020-01-26 Sun 12:19]
</p>
<p>This first combo is the first attempt at a waveform combo.
Waveforms are arranged in ascending order, which also
correlates with more high-frequency spectral content.
</p>
<p>I was hoping these waveforms morphing together would
sound more "talky". It's more of a resonant sound, kind of
like a resonant lowpass filter, but with a bit more crunch
at the upper-end. At certain ranges, it sounds a bit like a
male "eh" sound, but that's as close as it gets.
</p>
<p>The waveforms I chose are not equidistance: 2, 4, 12. When
strung together, it gives subtle non-linear response
while morphing. 2 was chosen to get a waveform with some
teeth. 4 has a bit more. 12 has upper frequency content,
but not too much to overdo it.
</p>
<p>When I wiggle the stylus in the upper left-hand corner of
the XY instrument (high frequency, mostly upper waveform),
there's a bit of helpless tiny animal shriek you can get.
It's annoying, but there's a place for it.
