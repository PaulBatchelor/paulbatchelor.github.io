<h1>Architecture Waveform Collection 2010</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>This is the Architecture Waveform collection, from
<a href="https://www.galbanum.com/products/architecturewaveforms2010/">Galbanum waveforms</a>.
</p>
<p>This is my initial attempt at trying to curate and document
these waveforms. The goal here is to provide something I can
look back on in future works.
</p>
<p>Work in progress, naturally.
</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>See: <a href="/smp/aw_stats">aw_stats</a>. (If this is
being dynamically generated, this may take a minute to
load.)

<h2>CLI Usage</h2>

<p>I'm assuming you have find this page this with
<code>weewiki server aw_2010_wav32.sqlar</code>.
</p>
<p>Well, this archive is also a fossil repository!
Open the repository with <code>fossil open aw_2010_wav32.sqlar</code>in a dedicated directory, and some files should appear.
Mainly, some org files and a Makefile.
</p>
<p>The Makefile has some helpful commands.
</p>
<p><code>make sync</code> will synchronize all linked org files to
the weewiki database.
</p>
<p><code>make ls</code> will list all the pages
</p>
<p><code>make server</code> will run the weewiki server on port 8080.
</p>
<p><code>make fserver</code> will run the fossil server on port 8081.
</p>
<p><code>make tangle</code> will tangle any scheme files utilized by
monolith test programs.
</p>

<h2>Push/Pull</h2>

<p>The push/pull scripts are used to quickly send Fossil and
WeeWiki data to/from the local instance on the computer to
an external flash drive (in this case Hermes). These scripts
work because the bulk of the information (SQLar) has already
been copied over.
</p>
<p>Be sure to make sure that the HERMES disk is mounted with
<code>mounter</code> (dbus service must be turned on for this to work).
</p>
<p>Note that pushing and pulling weewiki is a bit of a fragile
operation due to the fact that things overwritten, rather
than smartly merged. Important wiki pages should be managed
via Fossil in case something does go wrong. The push and
pull scripts will appropriately update and sync before doing
anything potentially bad. Between that and Fossil, the risk
is close to zero.
</p>

<h2>Messages</h2>

<p><b>[ec0f6f70] 2021-12-03-15-47</b>: ps48,440,30: a lot of highs, something that sounds like a fifth. not a low of low end.
</p>
<p><b>[f78291d8] 2021-11-30-15-50</b>: ps48,440,10: chorusing, typical chorusing.
</p>
<p><b>[aaa205fa] 2021-11-30-15-49</b>: ps48,440,100: a pretty decent cloud.
</p>
<p><b>[f7a88f0f] 2021-11-30-13-58</b>: ps48,110,10: very shrill and not at all pleasant.
</p>
<p><b>[0051c793] 2021-11-30-13-28</b>: fm48,119: sparse sounding spectrum, almost sounding an octave higher.
</p>
<p><b>[c51965c4] 2021-11-25-13-00</b>: ps48,110,50: almost sounds like someone is going 'oooh'
</p>
<p><b>[13f7a194] 2021-11-25-12-57</b>: fm48,119: very squary.
</p>
<p><b>[4e3cb994] 2021-11-19-11-12</b>: playing around with this wavetable today using gosc, instead of in an FM context. really shrill sound, even at low frequencies like nn36. kind of cool.
</p>
<p><b>[edabb989] 2021-11-15-17-28</b>: fm42,119: this seems to be about the cutoff point where it stops being talky.
</p>
<p><b>[fe7cb491] 2021-11-15-17-26</b>: fm36,119: cool buzz and stuff, it's not really talking anymore at this depth.
</p>
<p><b>[d2aebd83] 2021-11-15-17-25</b>: fm60,119: it's a noisy, but not as bad as I expected. still kinda talky here, which is cool. Now I want to do 2 octaves lower.
</p>
<p><b>[9d377a15] 2021-11-15-17-23</b>: fm48,119: this one has some very vowely formants that dance a bit when you turn up the index. It does seem to want to alias a bit at the top. It probably won't sound too great an octave higher.
</p>
<p><b>[8be1dd09] 2021-11-15-17-20</b>: fm60,119: actually pretty pleasant and well rounded. seems to be pretty rare so far in my wavetable searches to have something that works at this pitch.
</p>
<p><b>[ab973177] 2021-11-15-17-18</b>: fm48,119: crunch, but a pretty tame spectrum otherwise in the growth.
</p>
<p><b>[7e30c909] 2021-11-14-16-56</b>: fm60,119: very present. maybe dial back the index a little bit?
</p>
<p><b>[612dd5e0] 2021-11-14-16-55</b>: fm48,119: this has body, and that kind of spectrum that feels close to FM classic, only crunchy.
</p>
<p><b>[2c1f0201] 2021-11-14-16-52</b>: fm60,119: very very noisy and aliasy. sounds very hoarse.
</p>
<p><b>[d255e8fb] 2021-11-14-16-51</b>: fm48,119: a bit of a noisy spectrum. a few piercing high frequencies.
</p>
<p><b>[21bf22ca] 2021-11-14-16-48</b>: fm60,119: piercing, but pure. reminds me of the shell shock ringing sound used by hollywood.
</p>
<p><b>[e269be4d] 2021-11-14-16-48</b>: fm48,119: lots spectrum in the highs. almost sounds like an octave above. there's a sounding third overtone partial that I can make out (on tiny speaker).
</p>
<p><b>[78e9061c] 2021-11-14-14-22</b>: fm24,119: super shrill, no low end basically.
</p>
<p><b>[247ac689] 2021-11-14-14-19</b>: fm48,119: very sparse spectrum. it's only when it gets up to the top that some high end activity begins to happen.
</p>
<p><b>[10b0e939] 2021-11-14-14-17</b>: fm48,119: very pulsey. brighter than usual. not too aliasy though.
</p>
<p><b>[3346be73] 2021-11-14-13-19</b>: welp, it looks like spetrallina has been encoded wrong. it's stereo when it should be mono.
</p>
<p><b>[d5cfb6d9] 2021-11-14-13-14</b>: so, this was was encoded incorrectly. Stereo instead of mono. investigating this folder.
</p>
<p><b>[b6f45ce3] 2021-11-11-12-36</b>: whoah, at around C-3, there's some very weird noisy evolution happening. the vibrato may be having an effect?
</p>
<p><b>[8ebf73bb] 2021-11-11-12-35</b>: fm60,11c: aliasy and mess. seems like this waveform decides to be chaotic 48 onwards. towards the end, some very interesting harmonic partials suddenly appear.
</p>
<p><b>[adae9cfc] 2021-11-11-12-35</b>: fm24,11a: a very quiet subdued bass.
</p>
<p><b>[3e5eb0da] 2021-11-11-12-35</b>: fm36,11a: what? weirdly normal sonding, considering there was a mess of sound an octave above. This is like if a grounded cable had class.
</p>
<p><b>[79f806af] 2021-11-11-12-34</b>: fm48,11a: discordant. lots of inharmonic spectrum here.
</p>
<p><b>[5a6611f2] 2021-11-11-12-32</b>: whoah, some crazy aliasing happens with pitch shifting, going from G4 to F#3. FM 1:1 index ~20. Accidental discovery. It's like a warble. Keeping it in this novembeat.
</p>
<p><b>[62d35280] 2021-11-11-12-30</b>: fm48,11a: a very controlled spectrum, with a bit of crunch. similar to gjjipkdwk, only a bit bolder.
</p>
<p><b>[ed25b66c] 2021-11-11-12-27</b>: fm48,11a: very PWM-y behavior. a very narrow duty-cycled pulse.
</p>
<p><b>[79620e65] 2021-11-11-12-25</b>: fm24,11a: you know, this spectrum feels vear linear. like, it doesn't dance like sine does. Feels very subtractive. useful for sure.
</p>
<p><b>[ece2c853] 2021-11-11-12-25</b>: fm60,11a: yeah it's a bit bright. compared to sine, there's more high frequency content to begin with.
</p>
<p><b>[0a9ce4c3] 2021-11-11-12-25</b>: fm48,11a: pretty straightahead sounding. Maybe a little brighter crunch than a typical FM sound, but overall very tame.
</p>
<p><b>[938fe892] 2021-11-09-09-20</b>: p60: yeah, it's aliasing like crazy. But it's making me think of crystalline structures. Could be useful with the right lowpass filter.
</p>
<p><b>[34ab4106] 2021-11-09-09-19</b>: p38: buzzy and grainy
</p>
<p><b>[4763d441] 2021-11-09-09-18</b>: fm60,115: towards the top, the sound starts to beat and gargle a bit.
</p>
<p><b>[3cb954ae] 2021-11-09-09-18</b>: fm36,11a; really cruncy tanpura-ish drone.
</p>
<p><b>[0118ce1e] 2021-11-09-09-16</b>: p60: very square-like spectrum.
</p>
<p><b>[1e216ee8] 2021-11-09-09-16</b>: fm24,11A: I've pitched this one down low to hear this clearly, but there's this weird shimmering sound that happens on top of everything else.
</p>
<p><b>[daecfad1] 2021-11-09-09-14</b>: p48: this has very similar qualities to my reference buzz wave. this makes sense, actually.
</p>
<p><b>[52e7b9e8] 2021-11-09-09-14</b>: fm60,115: very conventional FM-sounding behavior. As the name suggests, it must be very sinusoidal.
</p>
<p><b>[930dfd1e] 2021-11-09-09-12</b>: p36: huh, I as kind of hoping for more low end. but this is just a very buzzy sound. I don't know how I'm going to use this.
</p>
<p><b>[4950cd2c] 2021-11-09-09-12</b>: p48: kind of that electricity sort of high end. definitely not great at this register.
</p>
<p><b>[2463454d] 2021-11-09-09-10</b>: fm48,139: this is a very unstable sound. lots of ugly beating. this waveform does not want to be a modulator. That is what it is telling me.
</p>
<p><b>[3685100c] 2021-11-08-10-01</b>: today is the first time novembeat has given me a wavetable from hm_amfmsine. lots of m's there. looking forward to exploring what sounds are in store here.
</p>
<p><b>[591c17cb] 2021-11-08-09-42</b>: f57,118: the beating pattern starts to get a little bit shrill at the top.
</p>
<p><b>[45a3d533] 2021-11-08-09-42</b>: f24,11F,13F: at this low pitch, 11F is really cool sounding with similar beating. by 13F, we have a more uniform timbre sweep and the beating goes away.
</p>
<p><b>[6002f4de] 2021-11-08-09-41</b>: fm48,119: like 36, but the beating is more here. harmonic overtone series.
</p>
<p><b>[11fa0a45] 2021-11-08-09-41</b>: fm36,119: okay, this one is really compelling. there's this beating that gets faster as it rises.
</p>
<p><b>[36d4269b] 2021-11-08-09-40</b>: p60: very present and tolerable at this range, especially with minor filtering and vibrato.
</p>
<p><b>[c8903a93] 2021-11-08-09-40</b>: p36: my first instict here was "bass clarinet", which isn't really true.
</p>
<p><b>[49bfdf80] 2021-11-08-09-39</b>: p48: very sawtoothular, pretty well rounded sound.
</p>
<p><b>[d39e6ea9] 2021-11-08-09-39</b>: fm57,118: not too offensive at this range. It starts to get a little bright at the top.
</p>
<p><b>[961c6f48] 2021-11-08-09-38</b>: fm36,119: lots of very interesting and subtle harmonic modulations over time.
</p>
<p><b>[1d0c04f7] 2021-11-08-09-38</b>: p36: behaves pretty well at this range
</p>
<p><b>[d321fb53] 2021-11-08-09-38</b>: p48: noisy and grainy, but there's still a pitch.
</p>
<p><b>[756cf2d8] 2021-11-08-09-37</b>: fm57,118: as it reaches th etop, there's this very particular partial that appears out of nowhere, it's a very interesting character in this spectrum.
</p>
<p><b>[1c62e2a5] 2021-11-08-09-36</b>: fm36,119: pretty controlled growth. nothing too crazy.
</p>
<p><b>[01fbcc77] 2021-11-08-09-36</b>: p36: this is just a classic FM sound, but sounding an octavbe higher, and in wavetable form.
</p>
<p><b>[e5bc6083] 2021-11-08-09-35</b>: p48: octave higher (so 2:1 or something). very sinusoidal still, so low modulation index?
</p>
<p><b>[25d88dc1] 2021-11-08-09-34</b>: fm57,118: really shrill, there's like no body. only the fundamental, bits on top, and no middle. higher 'm' ratios here do not help.
</p>
<p><b>[e06af811] 2021-11-08-09-33</b>: fm36,118,138: 118 doesn't have a lot of growth. 138 is a little better.
</p>
<p><b>[95507208] 2021-11-08-09-33</b>: p24: these binadd waveforms seem to be really neat at this low range. they start beating at the higher frequencies. It makes me think about giant grasshoppers.
</p>
<p><b>[c85f2b50] 2021-11-08-09-32</b>: p36: kind of has a shrillness to it. like a resonance you'd find on a self-resonating lowpass filter.
</p>
<p><b>[14f9c719] 2021-11-08-09-32</b>: p48: very formanty and talky
</p>
<p><b>[ee426428] 2021-11-07-09-16</b>: the name of the game is managing all the higher spectrums and harmonics. I can see why these are used a lot in subtractive synthesis. Something to think about.
</p>
<p><b>[7a061538] 2021-11-07-09-15</b>: really struggling with these wavetables. I find myself fighting to get them to do anything other than being noisy (used in an FM oscillator). My next strategy is to only use sine waves for the carrier, and have modulator be crazy. that way, the index can hopefully be a more intuitive timbre control. oh, modulation index needs to be more subtle too.
</p>
<p><b>[f37242d9] 2021-11-07-09-13</b>: p24: sounds like a loose ground wire. not really pitched.
</p>
<p><b>[2838fa9d] 2021-11-07-09-12</b>: p36: lots of upper harmonics.
</p>
<p><b>[11cfdb81] 2021-11-07-09-12</b>: p48: very piercing higher frequencies at 48. Makes me want to pitch it down.
</p>
<p><b>[b67031f9] 2021-11-07-09-10</b>: p24: getting some lansky mild und leise vibes, as heard in radiohead's idioteque. it's a very grounded sound.
</p>
<p><b>[a6a5c035] 2021-11-07-09-09</b>: p36: very clear to me at this point that the base frequency is totally gone. All you hear are the upper harmonics. Probably something to layer with.
</p>
<p><b>[ddc0770f] 2021-11-07-09-09</b>: p48: very bright upper harmonics. bottom harmonics drop out. probably a very high modulation index and C:M ratio.
</p>
<p><b>[2dff6f7f] 2021-11-07-09-07</b>: p24: kind of this emerging high end. I h ear the lower harmonics and fundamental maybe I think? it's subdued. kinda meh down here.
</p>
<p><b>[8a9ae6e7] 2021-11-07-09-06</b>: p36: very noisy! very hard to hear a pitch.
</p>
<p><b>[eb00d50e] 2021-11-07-09-06</b>: p48: low end seems to drop out on this one. there's definitely some kind of buzz, like a fluorescent light.
</p>
<p><b>[23e7ccd8] 2021-11-07-09-04</b>: p24: compared to the reference buzz wave it is crossfading between, it is quite calm.
</p>
<p><b>[e8f495e0] 2021-11-07-09-03</b>: p36: this sounds just like it came from risset mutations, especially the bits in the beginning. it's got this faint eerie vibe to it.
</p>
<p><b>[39d2c6bd] 2021-11-07-09-02</b>: p48: I get an old-school additive risset vibe about this. sparse spectrum, mostly sinusoidal, but with a spectrum above. upper harmonics sounds related to natural harmonic series.
</p>
<p><b>[c8af75ef] 2021-11-06-13-35</b>: test message, please ignore.
</p>
<p><b>[fbd5e76b] 2021-11-06-07-29</b>: fifths! sounds like fifths. probably why it is called 'partial'.
</p>
<p><b>[0d1705c9] 2021-11-06-07-27</b>: very FM-y, as the filename would imply.
</p>
<p><b>[729d74c1] 2021-11-06-07-25</b>: C-3: kind of sounds like it is saying 'eh'.
</p>
<p><b>[b9696436] 2021-11-06-07-24</b>: C-3: very buzzy, lots of high/mids, not much low end.
</p>
<p><b>[2c3e4290] 2021-11-05-09-35</b>: it's really hard to manage some of these waveforms for things that aren't bass. there's a lot of brightness to fight here.
</p>
<p><b>[61a1fdff] 2021-11-05-09-34</b>: at middle C: almost sounds vocal-liked. when modulated with itself in a 1:1 FM setting, it has a really reedy sound to it. bandoneon? saxophone?
</p>
<p><b>[8e6ff4be] 2021-11-05-09-32</b>: at middle C: is quite piercing. reminds me of a fire alarm.
</p>
<p><b>[7c6c6f7e] 2021-11-05-09-32</b>: at middle C: just crackles. lots of high frequency content (probably even more junk I can't hear).
</p>
<p><b>[00a60ec4] 2021-11-05-09-31</b>: pitched at middle C: has a lot of aliasing sounds to it. but it has body.
</p>
<p><b>[4ae02bce] 2021-11-04-09-41</b>: using this one in novembeat, I found it had a lot really high frequency content that only was usable with oscillators at low frequencies. I ended up producing some really gnarly insect-like sounds using it with an FM pair.
</p>
<p><b>[cd8a13a8] 2020-12-17-16-55</b>: this one references a message that belongs to AKWF, but it itself belongs to aw_2010.
</p>
<p><b>[88033135] 2020-12-17-16-33</b>: sidenote, I think I might need a better way to link messages to groups. remembering UUIDs isn't easy and they aren't fun to type either.
</p>
<p><b>[25878ded] 2020-12-17-16-32</b>: the instrument will probably need to be rewritten entirely. a lot has changed since I wrote it.
</p>
<p><b>[23c560cf] 2020-12-17-16-30</b>: I just imported a bunch of my old notes for this. Could be a decent start. There is an instrument written for testing stuff in monolith using a graphics tablet. Not sure how well it'll work still.
</p>
<p><b>[1d635739] 2020-12-17-14-53</b>: this waveform collection is massive! generated TSV right now is 4.7mb!
