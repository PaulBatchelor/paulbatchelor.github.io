<h1>unfa</h1>
<p>These are some one-shot drum samples from unfa beatboxing.
</p>
<p>I believe it is this one found here:
<a href="https://freesound.org/people/unfa/sounds/521139/">https://freesound.org/people/unfa/sounds/521139/</a></p>
<p><b>[bf2fbc45] 2020-12-22-17-10</b>: these three samples from the unfa library were used to make a simple drumkit (hh, snare, kick) in the breathingcard etude tairyzesh.
</p>
<p><b>[49e08f2d] 2020-12-22-17-04</b>: unfa beatboxing samples imported! some of these were used in a #breathingcard called "tairyzesh"
