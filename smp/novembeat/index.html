<h1>Novembeat Logs</h1>
<p>I briefly participated in Novembeat 2021 as a way
to explore drum samples and wavetable samples. Messages

<p><b>[a3ee08c6] 2021-11-12-20-30</b>: deciding not to use this. less is more, and I like the sparse mix.
</p>
<p><b>[b6f45ce3] 2021-11-11-12-36</b>: whoah, at around C-3, there's some very weird noisy evolution happening. the vibrato may be having an effect?
</p>
<p><b>[5a6611f2] 2021-11-11-12-32</b>: whoah, some crazy aliasing happens with pitch shifting, going from G4 to F#3. FM 1:1 index ~20. Accidental discovery. It's like a warble. Keeping it in this novembeat.
</p>
<p><b>[00239360] 2021-11-09-09-33</b>: this is some kind of strange hihat sound. high frequency. going to be used for 'restful' novembeat prompt, so I'm thinking this fits in as a kind of desert sound.
</p>
<p><b>[930dfd1e] 2021-11-09-09-12</b>: p36: huh, I as kind of hoping for more low end. but this is just a very buzzy sound. I don't know how I'm going to use this.
</p>
<p><b>[3685100c] 2021-11-08-10-01</b>: today is the first time novembeat has given me a wavetable from hm_amfmsine. lots of m's there. looking forward to exploring what sounds are in store here.
</p>
<p><b>[96225619] 2021-11-08-09-52</b>: they call this a tambourine roll. I'm almost getting a cricket/insect vibe from it. which is good for the theme of novembeat today: floral.
</p>
<p><b>[3b6dc4a8] 2021-11-07-09-40</b>: this tom has punch! it's very big. in novembeat, I'm using this without the other toms which may be taking it out of context. May have to group these together more frequently.
</p>
<p><b>[9375156a] 2021-11-02-09-53</b>: thinking about using the LinnLinn-9000 drum samples today.
</p>
<p><b>[17341d9f] 2021-11-02-09-37</b>: The KawaiR50 was used for this beat. This has a very mechanical sound that I struggled with at first. It wasn't until I started making things faster an added velocity and ghost notes that things felt a little bit better. Also added some random pitch shifting too cuz why not it's there.
