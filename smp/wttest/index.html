<title>Wavetable Testing</title>
<h1>Wavetable Testing</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Stuff tagged with the <code>wttest</code> tag are subjected to
forms of wavetable testing and evaluation.
</p>
<p>How does one evaluate the characteristic of a wavetable?
For me, mechanical non-audio processes like waveforms and
magnitude spectrum plots are only so useful. I'd like
to try and use my ears and listen.
</p>

<h2>Buzz Morphing Oscillator</h2>

<p>To evaluate the sonic qualities of a waveform, you really
want to be as no-frills as possible. I reach for a 
table lookup oscillator play a steady-pitch. I've found it's
help to have a reference wavetable to play against. A
band-limited buzzwave is good because it has a pretty rich
spectrum without being too abrasive.
</p>
<p>The code below implements a test oscillator for wavetables
using monolith. It morphs between a wavetable crate ID <code>wt</code>and a buzzwave at a fixed pitch <code>nn</code> (in MIDI).
</p>
<pre><code>(define (testwt nn wt)
  (let ((ftl (monolith:nextfree 0)))
    (ftlist-new)
    (regset zz ftl)

    (ftlist-append
      (lambda () (gen_sinesum (ftnew 8192) "0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2"))
      (reggetf ftl))
    (ftlist-append
      (lambda () (monft wt))
      (reggetf ftl))


      (phasor (mtof nn) 0)
    (tabmorf zz (expmap (flipper (phasor 0.3 0)) -1)
             (reggetf ftl))
    (mul zz 0.3)
    (regclr ftl)))</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>I've been listening to wavetables at 3 octaves currently.
Pitched at 24 (p24), 36 (p36), and 48 (p48). Wavetable
spectrums usually have a sweet spot, or they only dont
sound like crap at very specific frequency regions.
</p>

<h2>FM testing</h2>

<p>Seeing how wavetables behave in the context of FM becomes
a bit more unpredictable. So this process is still evolving.
</p>
<p>The core oscillator used is a classic FM pair. The idea would
be to mix and match classic sine tables with the current
wavetable. To keep things simple, a 1:1 ratio will be used
mostly. Modulation index will be routinely adjusted just
to see how the timbre changes.
</p>
<p>Here's a test FM oscillator:
</p>
<p>The gist is: create an FM oscillator pair, with sine
as carrier and wt as modulator, and slowly drive the
modulation index up and down. The thing to listen for
hear is the behavior of spectrum evolution.
</p>
<p>Note that the tables <b>might</b> have to match still.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;top&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>(define (testfm wt nn car mod mi)
  (fmpair2
    (mtof nn)
    (param car) (param mod)
    (scale (expmap (flipper (phasor 0.3 0)) -1) 0 mi)
    (param 0.0)
    (lambda () (gen_sine (ftnew 2048)))
    (lambda () (monft wt)))
  (mul zz 0.5))</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>If I wanted to test a wavetable with this patch using
a pitch 36 with a C:M ratio of 1:2, and a max mod index
of 6, I'd declare it as <code>fm36,126</code>. triplet values can
be a hex for a range of 0-15.
</p>

<h2>Padsynth testing</h2>

<p>As it turns out, wavetables make for great inputs
for the padsynth algorithm! So we're going to be
experimenting with those for a little while.
</p>
<p>The utility <code>pstest</code> can be used to generate files
with the following parameters, note number, base
frequency, and bandwidth.
</p>
<p>It is typical practice to prepend messages related
to testing the wavetable with the pstest utility
with: pstestNN,FREQ,BW.
</p>

<h2>LIL implementations</h2>

<p>Here is an implementation in LIL, using the local version
of <a href="/smp/sndkit">sndkit</a>.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;wttest.lil&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>&lt;&lt;wttest&gt;&gt;</pre></code>
<p></p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;wttest&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>func wttfm {wt nn c m i} {
    gensine [tabnew 8192]
    cratewav $wt
    mtof $nn
    param $c
    param $m
    phasor 0.3 0
    flipper zz
    expmap zz -1
    scale zz 0 $i
    param 0
    fmpair2 zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz
    mul zz 0.5
}</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Note that <code>wt</code> is ignored here, but it is included here
to match the <code>wttfm</code> function argument structure. This
makes the <code>fmtest</code> utility much easier to work with.
</p>
<div><b><i>&lt;&lt;wttest&gt;&gt;=</i></b></div><pre><code>func wttfm_ref {wt nn c m i} {
    gensine [tabnew 8192]
    dup
    mtof $nn
    param $c
    param $m
    phasor 0.3 0
    flipper zz
    expmap zz -1
    scale zz 0 $i
    param 0
    fmpair2 zz zz zz zz zz zz zz zz
    mul zz 0.5
}</pre></code>
