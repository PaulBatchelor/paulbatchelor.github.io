<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>How to use this thing.
</p>
<p>This is a specially managed weewiki and zet. Careful usage
is required.
</p>
<p>Writing stuff down as I go.
</p>

<h2>Utilities</h2>

<p>Utilities are stored in the "u" folder. These
are small shell scripts wrapped around weewiki that
do specific things.
</p>

<h3>zsay</h3>

<p>Most of what happens here is making logs. Do this
with <code>u/zsay</code>.
</p>

<h3>cgroups</h3>

<p>Print all the crate items associated with a particular
group. Will display the filename, as well as the UUID
in ergo-id format for easier typing.
</p>
<p>Example: print all the items with the USED tag.
<pre><code>u/cgroups USED</pre></code>

<h3>rpicker</h3>

<p>This is a helpful utility that allows one to randomly pick
samples from a group.
</p>
<p>Note that at the time of writing, this doesn't have an
ignore group, which would enable choices to include samples
that haven't been used before (via excluding the USED group).
</p>

<h3>hist</h3>

<p>The <code>hist</code> command provides a nice view of the most recently
commented samples in a group, and their message history.
</p>
<pre><code>u/hist @aw_2010% 10</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This one can take a few seconds to load.
</p>

<h2>Logs</h2>

<p>Logs are short timestamped messages added to the
zettelkasten. The idea is to take notes about various
samples and collections.
</p>
<p>For general messages, use the <code>logs</code> tag.
</p>
<pre><code>u/zsay @logs</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Logs are also tied to specific sqlar groups.
</p>
<p>Be sure to periodically dump the zet with <code>dumpzet.sh</code>.
</p>
<p>If you don't do this, stuff won't be saved.
</p>
<p>It is <b>very</b> important that you tie whatever is being
said to <b>exactly one</b> group that gets explicitely
exported. If you don't, the message will get erased. If
you link more than one, it will get duplicated in the repo.
</p>
<p>What are explicitely exported groups? See the <code>dump_zet</code>script.
</p>

<h2>Importing new samples</h2>

<p>Importing new samples.
</p>
<p>First you need to convert the sample collection into a sqlar
archive. Place them into a top level folder and run this
command:
</p>
<pre><code>sqlar foo.sqlar foo</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>It's <b>very</b> important that there isn't a slash after the
foo. For some reason using <code>foo/</code> would make it so the
folder doesn't show up in <code>sqlarfs</code>.
</p>
<p>After this is created it can be imported. Do this from
the directory where the sqlar archive is located, not where
the smp db is located. Then run:
</p>
<pre><code>weewiki crate import PATH_TO_SMP/a.db foo.sqlar</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>See if the import worked with:
</p>
<pre><code>u/cgroups foo.sqlar</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Once imported, it's really important to make a new directory
in the smp folder, and optionally a landing page.
</p>
<p>From there, it needs to be exported to a TSV file, so
it can be managed in source control.
</p>
<pre><code>weewiki zet export foo.sqlar &gt; foo/zet.tsv</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Add all these files and make a commit.
</p>
<p>After that, you'll need to add these entries to the
<code>dump_zet.sh</code> and <code>mkdb.sh</code> scripts.
</p>
<p>in <code>dump_zet.sh</code>, add:
</p>
<pre><code>zetout foo</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>in <code>mkdb.sh</code>, add:
</p>
<pre><code>zetit foo</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, don't forget to import any wiki pages in the
<code>genwiki.janet</code> script.
</p>

<h2>Copying SQLar archives</h2>

<p>SQLar archives, once imported, don't always need to be
present. They can be removed (not implemented yet), copied
again.
</p>
<p>To copy a sample database previously imported, use the <code>copy</code>command. For instance:
</p>
<pre><code>weewiki crate copy ~/sqlar/aw_2010_wav32.sqlar a.db</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>Will transfer the samples over to the smp's database <code>a.db</code>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there isn't an inverse operation for this
yet. But if you know the folder samples are in, they can
be removed using sqlar's <code>-d</code> command.
</p>

<h2>Using a Sample</h2>

<p>When a sample gets used for the first time, it should
get tagged with the <code>USED</code> label via linking:
</p>
<pre><code>u/tag UUID USED</pre></code>
<p></p>
<p>This lets me know what samples I have used and have not used.
