<h1>AKWF</h1>
<p>This is the top-level page dedicated to discussing the
analogue-kid waveform pack, aka AKWF.
</p>
<p><b>[e69de4cf] 2021-01-24-14-41</b>: I need to rethink how to play with the "classic" waveforms. They kind of need to be tested within themselves. Otherwise... boring.
</p>
<p><b>[de65cb2a] 2021-01-24-14-38</b>: oh this one sounds new. It doesn't have a lot of bottom, but there's some compelling grit in the mid-low areas. I very much want to try putting vibrato and chorusing on it.
</p>
<p><b>[af43baa8] 2021-01-24-14-35</b>: they call this one a "gapsaw". Probably has to do with what it looks like. It just sounds like a saw wave. Ugh. I'm not feeling inspired looking at these primitive waveforms in isolation.
</p>
<p><b>[96938eab] 2021-01-24-14-32</b>: b7692 is definitely a square wave. If I were to guess, 50% duty cycle. not very interesting tbh.
</p>
<p><b>[19d95a2c] 2021-01-24-14-29</b>: d76ae4 is a very noisy raw waveform. I initially tried it out a 440hz and it was aliasing like crazy. very bright and buzzy at lower frequencies.
</p>
<p><b>[af8daa13] 2020-12-25-21-23</b>: tried using this granular waveform as a modulation source (LFO), and it had kind of a pulsar effect?
</p>
<p><b>[8ed66eb0] 2020-12-25-20-00</b>: this one, like 19263%, has a lot of crunch, but less of it. buzz perhaps? I'll give it both. I'm making these labels up as I go along.
</p>
<p><b>[635022dd] 2020-12-25-19-57</b>: this waveform perceptually sounds an octave higher, which is why it sounds better pitched lower.
</p>
<p><b>[eabb024a] 2020-12-25-19-54</b>: this one sounds like an old school polypulse. like you'd hear on an arcade. very crunchy and bitcrushed.
</p>
<p><b>[590f4f3e] 2020-12-25-19-51</b>: this one is very very bright. had to tune the initial oscillator to 100hz just to get a sensible sound.
</p>
<p><b>[c602a8f5] 2020-12-24-10-21</b>: this mystery waveform is also quite dark and epiano/FM like. also kind of reminds me of the phase modulation stuff I do at low settings.
</p>
<p><b>[c44a383a] 2020-12-24-10-19</b>: oh yeah. this epiano sound is definitely FM. it has that classic dark FM pair sound where the C:M and modulation index is low.
</p>
<p><b>[2f6fab10] 2020-12-24-10-15</b>: very reedy. almost square wave like. I usually think of triangle waves as being a lot duller.
</p>
<p><b>[c7948f43] 2020-12-23-08-04</b>: this sound is from one of the numbered groups. no clue what this is going to correspond to.
</p>
<p><b>[00674ece] 2020-12-23-08-03</b>: this waveform is from the epiano (<a href="/smp/akwf">akwf</a>) group. they probably sampled it from some electric piano they had. usually this is either some kind of rhodes or dx7 tine sound. will be interested to what comes out in the waveform.
</p>
<p><b>[3b86669a] 2020-12-23-08-00</b>: this waveform is from the <code>bw_tri</code> group, which I assume means it's a triangle bandlimited waveform? I consider triangles to be sonically in a similar space to sine waves, with a bit more spectral grit.
</p>
<p><b>[9e192e84] 2020-12-22-09-56</b>: I don't even have to visualize the waveform, I know this is a ramped sawtooth. I just sonified it as an LFO.
</p>
<p><b>[8e406b52] 2020-12-22-09-44</b>: raw3 is kind of inbetween. squ-15 and 9-899. it's not getting me all that excited. I'm going to try using it as a modulation source today.
</p>
<p><b>[00840420] 2020-12-22-09-40</b>: the 9-899 waveform has the most lyrical qualities. probably will work best pitched at singing registers with vibrato or something.
</p>
<p><b>[15949857] 2020-12-22-09-38</b>: of the 3, the squ-15 waveform has the most character at low frequencies (~20hz).
</p>
<p><b>[4cb0d1e1] 2020-12-22-09-33</b>: this one is the gentlest of the 3 waveforms I'm trying today. has a very subtractive synthesis quality to it. like it has been lowpassed filtered. could be sawtoothular or low indexed FM. filename does not give anything away.
</p>
<p><b>[a80fe54e] 2020-12-22-09-28</b>: compared to squ-15, this raw wave sounds very saw-toothy to my ears. but that's not saying much.
</p>
<p><b>[2f6842d6] 2020-12-22-09-24</b>: using squ-15 in a code fragment wt2. it's a noisy square, as expected.
</p>
<p><b>[2e0df0cc] 2020-12-19-17-12</b>: been leaning on this waveform pretty heavily in the wt1 patch. the chiptune arps really bring out the character of it and it scratches an itch.
</p>
<p><b>[d600a8ab] 2020-12-19-15-19</b>: the difference between these two is in the dusty aliasing noise above. at 330hz coming out of my (<a href="#">minirig</a>), this one has brighter dust than 13.
</p>
<p><b>[616a547d] 2020-12-19-15-12</b>: picked this triangle wave at random. sounds like... a triangle wave? random selection and comparison next.
</p>
<p><b>[b718e248] 2020-12-19-15-10</b>: vgsaw0001. humans are phase blind, so I am sure if I plotted these I would see dramatic differences.
</p>
<p><b>[d0176f2b] 2020-12-19-15-04</b>: compared to vgsaw-0001, a little bit darker. I wonder if there is a pattern.
</p>
<p><b>[a4546943] 2020-12-19-11-56</b>: definitely some issues. applying some sed magic on the tsvs in AKWF folder.
</p>
<p><b>[abcaf26f] 2020-12-19-09-37</b>: there seems to be a discrepency in case. in SQLar the top-level file is 'akwf'. in the zet it's 'AKWF'. wonder if it'll work.
</p>
<p><b>[b4028653] 2020-12-19-09-35</b>: this also begins sample curation. here we go.
</p>
<p><b>[6af2fd93] 2020-12-19-09-34</b>: this is my first attempt actually trying to use crates in monolith, so this might be slow going at first.
</p>
<p><b>[5aa020da] 2020-12-19-09-33</b>: trying to build an instrument today using akwf. starting with AKWF_vgamebasic because I want bright bloops for the (<a href="#">codex</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[919bc737] 2020-12-17-17-54</b>: one of the things I am expecting with the AKWF collection is that they are bright and chiptune-y. perfect for the kind of manic aesthetic I am trying to get with the #codex.
</p>
<p><b>[e2fbb11c] 2020-12-17-16-57</b>: AKWF will probably be the next thing I'll be jumping into for both #tudes and the #codex.
</p>
<p><b>[3540485b] 2020-12-17-16-54</b>: should be able to reference core groups a bit more easily now when writing logs.
