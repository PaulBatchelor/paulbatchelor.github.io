<h3>gphqwqork</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/fm_3/fm3_03_08_05.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-12-03-15-47] ps48,440,30: a lot of highs, something that sounds like a fifth. not a low of low end.
</p>
</p>

<h3>gkkfjirki</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/add_binaddint_4/binadd_int_4_10011001.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-30-15-49] ps48,440,100: a pretty decent cloud.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-30-15-50] ps48,440,10: chorusing, typical chorusing.
</p>
</p>

<h3>grlijsilq</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/add_partials2n/partials_11_13.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-30-13-28] fm48,119: sparse sounding spectrum, almost sounding an octave higher.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-30-13-58] ps48,110,10: very shrill and not at all pleasant.
</p>
</p>

<h3>ghossusau</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/spectral_sposc_2lin/sposc2_lin_7_3_9_8_2.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-25-12-57] fm48,119: very squary.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-25-13-00] ps48,110,50: almost sounds like someone is going 'oooh'
</p>
</p>

<h3>gjlkljfap</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/spectral_spm_linb/spm_linb_064_04_004_16.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-15-17-23] fm48,119: this one has some very vowely formants that dance a bit when you turn up the index. It does seem to want to alias a bit at the top. It probably won't sound too great an octave higher.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-15-17-25] fm60,119: it's a noisy, but not as bad as I expected. still kinda talky here, which is cool. Now I want to do 2 octaves lower.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-15-17-26] fm36,119: cool buzz and stuff, it's not really talking anymore at this depth.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-15-17-28] fm42,119: this seems to be about the cutoff point where it stops being talky.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-19-11-12] playing around with this wavetable today using gosc, instead of in an FM context. really shrill sound, even at low frequencies like nn36. kind of cool.
</p>
</p>

<h3>gerripsoe</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/spectral_spm_ilowfreq/spmi_low_e_0108.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-15-17-18] fm48,119: crunch, but a pretty tame spectrum otherwise in the growth.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-15-17-20] fm60,119: actually pretty pleasant and well rounded. seems to be pretty rare so far in my wavetable searches to have something that works at this pitch.
</p>
</p>

<h3>galwawqpj</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/fm_3/fm3_04_06_03.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-14-16-55] fm48,119: this has body, and that kind of spectrum that feels close to FM classic, only crunchy.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-14-16-56] fm60,119: very present. maybe dial back the index a little bit?
</p>
</p>

<h3>gdsjjewkj</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/fm_2varriableindex/fm2_c11/fm2_11_14_16.00.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-14-16-51] fm48,119: a bit of a noisy spectrum. a few piercing high frequencies.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-14-16-52] fm60,119: very very noisy and aliasy. sounds very hoarse.
</p>
</p>

<h3>gfpefpuef</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/fm_2varriableindex/fm2_c15/fm2_15_02_01.00.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-14-16-48] fm48,119: lots spectrum in the highs. almost sounds like an octave above. there's a sounding third overtone partial that I can make out (on tiny speaker).
</p>
<p>[2021-11-14-16-48] fm60,119: piercing, but pure. reminds me of the shell shock ringing sound used by hollywood.
</p>
</p>

<h3>gieoorfwh</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/misc_impulsetrain/impulse_train_tri_032.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-14-14-19] fm48,119: very sparse spectrum. it's only when it gets up to the top that some high end activity begins to happen.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-14-14-22] fm24,119: super shrill, no low end basically.
</p>
</p>

<h3>geflsulaf</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/spectral_sposc_2lin/sposc2_lin_4_0_9_3_2.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-14-14-17] fm48,119: very pulsey. brighter than usual. not too aliasy though.
</p>
</p>

<h3>giksaphjw</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/spectral_spm_lina/spm_lina_07_0256_1_2.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-14-13-14] so, this was was encoded incorrectly. Stereo instead of mono. investigating this folder.
</p>
</p>

<h3>gadaqakeo</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/spectral_spm_lina/spm_lina_64_1024_0_3.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-11-12-34] fm48,11a: discordant. lots of inharmonic spectrum here.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-11-12-35] fm36,11a: what? weirdly normal sonding, considering there was a mess of sound an octave above. This is like if a grounded cable had class.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-11-12-35] fm24,11a: a very quiet subdued bass.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-11-12-35] fm60,11c: aliasy and mess. seems like this waveform decides to be chaotic 48 onwards. towards the end, some very interesting harmonic partials suddenly appear.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-11-12-36] whoah, at around C-3, there's some very weird noisy evolution happening. the vibrato may be having an effect?
</p>
</p>

<h3>gsdiqeods</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/spectral_sposc_lini/sposc_lin_1.414_008_004.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-11-12-30] fm48,11a: a very controlled spectrum, with a bit of crunch. similar to gjjipkdwk, only a bit bolder.
</p>
<p>[2021-11-11-12-32] whoah, some crazy aliasing happens with pitch shifting, going from G4 to F#3. FM 1:1 index ~20. Accidental discovery. It's like a warble. Keeping it in this novembeat.
</p>
</p>

<h3>glhhpakfa</h3>

<p><b>Filename:</b> /aw_2010_wav32/spectral_gatelin/sp_gate_lin_07_10_a.wav
</p>
<p>[2021-11-11-12-27] fm48,11a: very PWM-y behavior. a very narrow duty-cycled pulse.
</p>
