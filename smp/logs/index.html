<h1>Logs</h1>
<p><b>[562d2e6e] 2023-02-05-06-20</b>: I believe it's been about a year since I looked at this. Wavetables were a big focus of this zet, and I ended up stopping because I wasn't satisfied with how I was using them. I have some new ideas, so hopefully this will propel me a bit further.
</p>
<p><b>[c16ebb9c] 2021-11-29-11-14</b>: going to try publishing the wiki bits on my website today.
</p>
<p><b>[cf8a95ee] 2021-11-28-19-34</b>: vocal tract (<a href="/smp/shapes">shapes</a>) added to this zet. this is the first time I've added RAW files instead WAV files.
</p>
<p><b>[fa91d02a] 2021-11-25-13-55</b>: the append utility will append a file to an existing SQLar archive, and create a new file entry in the zet.
</p>
<p><b>[a7c9b45d] 2021-11-21-10-55</b>: created pswt utility for quickly generated padsynth wavetables from spectrum of smaller wavetables
</p>
<p><b>[b5e22cb2] 2021-11-21-10-24</b>: getting an initial implementation of padsynth working with sndkit, so I've added a tester called pstest which allows wavetables to be turned into padsynth timbres.
</p>
<p><b>[24fb1808] 2021-11-21-06-47</b>: I'm finding myself want to append samples and files to SQLar files, and update the entries. There is no good way to do that right now.
</p>
<p><b>[d66c0c08] 2021-11-19-14-51</b>: the use of uncompress in the SQLar spec is a headache. I ended up having to write C code just to extract files for something that could have nearly have been all done using SQLite CLI and standard shell script tools.
</p>
<p><b>[9d9f6620] 2021-11-18-09-55</b>: made it possible to export the wiki components to HTML, so you could use a local http server to browse a cached copy of the zet. this makes it faster to browse. also, althttpd is really neat :)
</p>
<p><b>[68c8cc7c] 2021-11-14-21-19</b>: added sampcount: a utility that will return the number of samples linked to a particular group.
</p>
<p><b>[640adca1] 2021-11-14-11-40</b>: lots of new stuff being made today in an effort to make some local testing utilities like in (<a href="/smp/wttest">wttest</a>). (<a href="/smp/sndkit">sndkit</a>) is now included with this distribution. I'm also toying the idea with making little subroutines and programs in LIL to make it easier to programatically test samples.
</p>
<p><b>[0c905008] 2021-11-14-09-31</b>: hopefully this (<a href="/smp/labels">labels</a>) page will turn into a useful landing page for browsing curated samples.
</p>
<p><b>[49de9db7] 2021-11-12-15-56</b>: added u/findused to help me look for previously used samples
</p>
<p><b>[c211cadc] 2021-11-12-15-25</b>: hasty tagging today for (<a href="/smp/novembeat">novembeat</a>). just not enough time. probably will want to scale back a bit.
</p>
<p><b>[50b71eaa] 2021-11-09-13-55</b>: added some stats functionality today and wow this thing is starting to resemble usefulness
</p>
<p><b>[9ae06967] 2021-11-08-09-44</b>: now that formal wavetable testing is happening with (<a href="/smp/wttest">wttest</a>), it might be cool to write programs that generate standardized sound files for critical listening. Would make it much more streamlined.
</p>
<p><b>[75adf7c5] 2021-11-06-13-52</b>: the u/hist utility provides a very nice view of recently logged samples tied to a group. will probably turn it into an HTML view at some point.
</p>
<p><b>[619af6fc] 2021-11-06-12-06</b>: adding a play shortcut that would resolve files and then play them in mplayer was a good idea. all I need to do is mount the sqlar via sqlarfs.
</p>
<p><b>[7c784745] 2021-11-05-11-56</b>: added rpicker. good design pattern to look at moving forward. really solidifies how self-contained scripts are going to be better than a monolithic CLI. Hopefully many more custom SQLite queries in the future.
</p>
<p><b>[645d9ee3] 2021-11-02-09-22</b>: on second thought, are the scripts really that bad? I mean it's not like the shell script could be used outside of the directory. plus, this makes it more decentralized. will push onwards with what I have so far.
</p>
<p><b>[faee33c5] 2021-11-02-09-14</b>: thinking I might turn my utilitie scripts into a shell script, similar to (<a href="#">zetdo</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[ccacef92] 2021-11-02-08-56</b>: added drums yesterday. still getting used to this system. it's all about habbits.
</p>
<p><b>[cf0efa6d] 2021-10-17-12-00</b>: wow, it has been months since I touched this. I'm swinging back into wavetables, thanks to Gest, my gesture synthesizer. That will enable me to dynamically morph between an arbitrary number of waveforms in arbitrary order. Really should set me forward.
</p>
<p><b>[d5f3a3f6] 2021-02-10-10-28</b>: just imported (<a href="/smp/kawaiwf">kawaiwf</a>), single cycle loops from the Kawai K1.
</p>
<p><b>[1863b00e] 2021-02-10-10-12</b>: also, introducing (<a href="/smp/sh1wf">sh1wf</a>). Found on lines the other day.
</p>
<p><b>[c2bf9c14] 2021-02-10-10-11</b>: disabled the references in the feed pages and re-enabled (<a href="/smp/aw_2010_wav32">aw_2010_wav32</a>). it was not worth the CPU cycles.
</p>
<p><b>[9f618f4a] 2021-01-24-15-10</b>: yup, big performance improvement disabling (<a href="#">aw_2020_wav32</a>). working off partial segments of the database seems like a design consideration moving forward.
</p>
<p><b>[0c0deb55] 2021-01-24-14-41</b>: with this wt6 exercise, I'm discovering that primitive waveshapes like triangles, squares, and sawtooths, need to be compared against themselves. Otherwise they sound bland and generic.
</p>
<p><b>[03cb3c38] 2021-01-22-09-44</b>: zing! here is the usage page: (<a href="/smp/usage">usage</a>)
</p>
<p><b>[706d4e05] 2021-01-22-09-42</b>: working on a usage page so I don't forget how to use this.
</p>
<p><b>[d30f5fb3] 2021-01-16-22-03</b>: I really need to make a README for how to use this system. It hasn't even been that long and I'm forgetting the conventions.
</p>
<p><b>[465c3e59] 2021-01-16-22-02</b>: I feel like it's been a while since I last did anything here. been a busy week. no time for fun and games. maybe tomorrow?
</p>
<p><b>[b4f8065c] 2021-01-16-22-01</b>: at some point, I will be extracting and documenting AAS sample packs here. Why they couldn't just supply the WAV files instead of their shit JSON format is beyond me.
</p>
<p><b>[7c36c212] 2021-01-16-22-00</b>: I just made a TODO app today that was a bunch of weewiki commands wrapped in one shell script. It's tempting to do the same here. It would make this system re-usable incase I wanted to start another one of these up again.
</p>
<p><b>[042e7cc8] 2021-01-03-10-23</b>: built tabmorf today. testing it out on some random (<a href="/smp/waveedit">waveedit</a>) waveforms today.
</p>
<p><b>[6b757307] 2020-12-25-19-45</b>: linked here are the 3 random waveforms attempted to be used. the goal is to build something pitched and controlled via a trigger.
</p>
<p><b>[acec5f3f] 2020-12-25-19-43</b>: a new wavetable study in #frags. this would be wt4.
</p>
<p><b>[add77274] 2020-12-24-11-26</b>: putting the tcross node in monolith to good use. it's made for wavetables. since it takes in a phasor, I can also apply phase distortion techniques to it as well.
</p>
<p><b>[2a6a54ee] 2020-12-24-10-16</b>: working on some abstractions for #monolith that will make it easier to test out waveforms. trying to make this a daily ritual for a while.
</p>
<p><b>[2eb903ef] 2020-12-23-09-19</b>: some mildly better presentation when display logs. abbreviated UUIDs are visible, and references are avaiable as well. at 60k rows, the query lag is noticeable, but tolerable.
</p>
<p><b>[5734d476] 2020-12-23-08-17</b>: off to make another fragment using 3 random (<a href="/smp/akwf">akwf</a>) wavetables
</p>
<p><b>[49539bb4] 2020-12-22-17-05</b>: the bc label is meant to be for things related to my breathing cards etude series.
</p>
<p><b>[e4336eb8] 2020-12-22-16-58</b>: imported some drum samples I cut from unfa beatboxing.
</p>
<p><b>[bdd552e4] 2020-12-22-14-30</b>: some more utilties managing labels and groups. I now can look up an entry and get the list of groups and labels they are a part of.
</p>
<p><b>[5b8157ed] 2020-12-22-11-51</b>: applying a @labels group. will make up categories as I go.
</p>
<p><b>[760a88f0] 2020-12-22-10-42</b>: some fruitful results using phase distortion today on an (<a href="/smp/akwf">akwf</a>) waveform. It'll be interesting to see what sort of timbral variety that technique will bring.
</p>
<p><b>[e934d56f] 2020-12-20-14-05</b>: today, I'm implementing a shuffle feature in the zet that allows me to randomly pick files given a pattern. the hope is to better automate guess-and-check.
</p>
<p><b>[48f9a5f6] 2020-12-19-15-36</b>: added some shell scripts in a folder called 'u'. should save a few keystrokes this way.
</p>
<p><b>[5103775e] 2020-12-19-12-41</b>: zet message generation for weewiki is up and running now. testing out (<a href="/smp/logs">logs</a>) and (<a href="/smp/akwf">akwf</a>).
</p>
<p><b>[16e1e3a3] 2020-12-19-12-40</b>: lots of duplicates removed. I have to be more careful about which groups I link messages too!
</p>
<p><b>[c15a4866] 2020-12-19-12-04</b>: success! first wavetable loaded from a crate into an instance of <code>oscf</code> via <code>monolith</code>. woo!
</p>
<p><b>[9c831de1] 2020-12-17-17-50</b>: there's no way to check if a entry belongs to exactly <b>one</b> of the core groups being exported. so it's very possible to create duplicate entries by mistake. we will cross that bridge when we get there. #updates
</p>
<p><b>[cb07b3a2] 2020-12-17-17-47</b>: this way, I don't have to do tree traversal and shit like that. just make sure messages are tied to this group.
</p>
<p><b>[e0e2bc6c] 2020-12-17-17-46</b>: adding a @logs virtual group to this zet, because it makes exporting an easier problem to solve.
</p>
<p><b>[a094f508] 2020-12-17-17-29</b>: yeah, this looks like something I made. will have to listen to this at some point.
