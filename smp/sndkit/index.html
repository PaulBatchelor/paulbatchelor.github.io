<h1>sndkit</h1>
<p>This zet contains a local copy of <code>sndkit</code>,
with a few specialized functions added to work with
the samples discussed here.
</p>

<h2>Buildling</h2>

<p>You should have sndkit installed already.
</p>
<p>Build it all with <code>make</code>.
</p>

<h2>LIL functions</h2>


<h3>Opendb</h3>

<p>Usage: opendb [filename]
</p>
<p>This will open up the SQLite database containing the zet.
If no filename is given, it will use "a.db". This database
gets implicitely used by some of the new functions added here,
so be sure to call this before running.
</p>

<h3>Cratewav</h3>

<p>Usage: cratewav UUID
</p>
<p>This will load a sample into a sndkit table from the crate,
given the UUID. The full ID does not need to be provided,
only enough digits so that it is unique. The ego-id format
is also supported here (the suffix must start with 'g').
