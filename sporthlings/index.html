<h1>Sporthlings</h1>
<p>A <strong>sporthling</strong> is a small snippet of sporth code, typically used to produce
a generative composition or sound object. </p>
<p>Sporthlings are my compositional etudes. I try to make as many as I can, as 
fast as I can, as often as I can. The more I make, the better I understand what 
<a href="/proj/sporth.html">Sporth</a> is supposed to be. </p>
<p>This page is a gallery of some of my notable sporthlings, complete with it's 
code, resources, and a short audio snippet.
