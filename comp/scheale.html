<h1>Scheale</h1>
<p><em>Scheale</em> is a generative ambient composition, written in my music language <a href="/proj/sporth.html">Sporth</a>.</p>
<p>It is the first attempt at composition using this language, and therefore the first Sporth
composition to ever exist in this universe.</p>
<p>My first stab at composing in Sporth was an interesting and fun challenge. All sounds
and note events were created through routing unit generators together, similar to how
a composition would be realized on a modular synthesizer. It was very easy to
build up very complicated patches. Even a few lines of Sporth code could yield
very hard to follow patches! For this reason, each instrument was split up into
different Sporth patches, where they were daisy-chained together in serial. </p>
