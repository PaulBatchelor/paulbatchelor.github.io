  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Today I realized that I’m lonely. It’s a kind of loneliness that comes from 
doing
lots of projects, but not sharing them with the world. I find myself
locked in my head in a sort of Mind Vault. At the moment, I am working on about
half a dozen personal projects relating to computer music and digital art. These
projects excite me greatly, and have kept me busy enough in my mostly solitary 
lifestyle. </p>

<p>Fortunately, this type of loneliness is easily fixable. I’ve decided that it’s 
about time 
I write these ideas down in one place, rather than let
them swim in my head. 
Some of these ideas are only ideas, and some of them have quite a bit
of code already written out. </p>

<p>In no particular order, here are some of my projects and what they do:</p>

<h2 id="prop">Prop</h2>
<p><em>Prop</em> is a micro notation language for rhythm written using C, Flex, and Bison.
Using the very simnple rules, one could build very complex and interesting 
rhythms based on proportions.
Prop falls into the same category of tools as 
<a href="http://paulbatchelor.github.io/portfolio/nrt_page.html">NRT</a> in that it is a 
text filter that
makes more meaningful text for compositional programs like Csound. This program 
is basically 
functional, and I even have an <a href="http://paulbatchelor.github.io/portfolio/prop_page.html">unfinished secret 
page</a> for it 
explaining some of the rules. 
I just haven’t found a moment to document it properly (There are pretty 
pictures!)</p>

<h2 id="lsamp">LSamp</h2>
<p><em>LSamp</em> is a lightweight sampler/archive format that errs on the side of being 
a little bit too lightweight. I initially came
up with this idea because I wanted a way to store multiple audio samples in a 
monolithic format, and I
found myself not really liking all the baggage attached. Since I had very 
specific ideas for what I wanted
in a sampler format, I figured it would be quicker and easier to come up with 
my own system rather than try to 
stumble through what already existed.</p>

<p>Most of LSamp is inspired by <a href="http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/tinycdb.html">TinyCDB</a>. 
Like TinyCDB, LSamp is designed with a some very firm limitations (samplerate 
is not 
specified, only 1-channel files, only 24-bit, 4 gig file limit, etc). These 
limitations help keep things simpler for the machine. 
Some other day, I may come up with tools to use with LSamp should these 
handicaps decide to bite me in the ass later.</p>

<p>I believe this format will help encourage me to write more sample-based 
compositions and to be more proactive about using
sounds I make on my field recorder. I also have high hopes that I’ll be able to 
convert many of the Renoise sliced breakbeat
files that I have on my computer into an easily maintainable lsamp format.</p>

<h2 id="soundpipe-redesign">SoundPipe (Redesign)</h2>
<p>It’s been almost a year since I’ve touched 
<a href="http://paulbatchelor.github.io/portfolio/soundpipe_page.html"><em>SoundPipe</em></a>, 
and it was a great way for me to learn about using Lua C API and libsndfile.
Since then, I’ve learned quite a bit about software design. In all honesty, the 
current SoundPipe codebase is sloppy. It’s full of
memory leaks. The Csound opcode ports are hacked together. The Lua code 
deviates to far away from the C code when really Lua should have
only acted as a wrapper. There is no easy way to add new effects to SoundPipe. </p>

<p>I’ve been very tempted to blow up the current codebase and start from scratch 
and redesign SoundPipe with more defined goals from the start.
I can definitely imaging being able to link this with all my other projects 
that I’m working on.</p>

<h2 id="brian">Brian</h2>
<p>I simply can’t forget about <a href="https://twitter.com/brianisnotabot"><em>Brian</em></a>, which 
started out as a pi-powered twitter bot that write little musical doodles. It 
was a very satisfying project, but 
my ideas outgrew the initial concept. The language (Ruby) wasn’t fast enough, 
and it wasn’t designed for the scale I had in mind. 
Brian ultimately stems from the idea that databases can be used to create 
music. Brian is a composer, and you are it’s muse. You (the human), 
supply the Brian with  snippets of musical data and possibilities to organize 
this data. and in turn, Brian treats this as inspiration for a 
composition. Over time, this data set will grow, and so will the complexity of 
the pieces Brian produces. It’s a composition that keeps 
on composing!</p>

<h2 id="slicer">Slicer</h2>
<p>I have a very strong interest in audio-visual music, and hope to someday be 
able create some of it myself. Realtime visuals were interesting to me, 
so naturally I gravitated towards processing. Processing did not run well on my 
old hardware, so I looked towards OpenFrameWorks. OFX was so 
frustrating to install on Linux and felt quite bloated to me. I just couldn’t 
get myself to face the dependency hell, having to work
in C++, AND being forced to learn a new IDE. Unsatisfied with what was 
available, I looked for a simple way to generate video for my music.
<em>Slicer</em> was born. Slicer uses the really Cairo graphics library to generate many 
pictures that can be sequenced together using a program like ffmpeg. 
It’s also has a csound score-like input file that can be used to sync audio 
events to picture. An example of this can be found <a href="https://vimeo.com/119976636">here</a>.</p>

<p>This code is pretty early on in development, but it works. My goal is to make 
Slicer look a little bit more like processing, and to write 
a piece of music with it that’s more than 2 minutes long.</p>

<h2 id="icsnd">iCsnd</h2>
<p><em>iCsnd</em> is basically going to be my stab at using csound to do live coding in a 
performance setting. A little while back, I made a proof-of-concept <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjSrh71B2yo">video</a>, but 
I’m pretty much going to 
rewrite everything to make it more efficient and portable. Some things are 
still up in the air, but I really want to see how I can use and abuse Csound’s 
orchestra macros to create
a very terse syntax geared for live coding.</p>
